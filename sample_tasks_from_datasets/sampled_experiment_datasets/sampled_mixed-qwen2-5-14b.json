mails and telephone calls , it was recognized that the toronto critical care community would benefit from regular teleconferences for several reasons . \n because sars was a new illness , a great deal was gained by providing a forum for the exchange of clinical information and advice . \n many health care providers felt isolated during the outbreak because regular hospital rounds and meetings were cancelled . \n furthermore , with infection control regulations limiting interhospital patient transfers , individuals had to manage cases that they might not usually have managed . \n finally , regular communication would allow coordinated data collection for the purposes of better understanding the critical care aspects of the illness . as a result , \n thrice weekly teleconference calls involving critical care clinicians , and invited representatives from public health , infection control , infectious diseases , government , and hospital administration were held . \n participants were identified by searching individual e - mail contact lists , personal communication , and announcements to hospital administrators through the ontario hospital association . during the calls clinical information and therapeutic challenges were discussed . \n in addition , we were able to dispel rumors , clarify media reports , synthesize the barrage of faxes and government directives , answer questions , and support those feeling isolated . \n the discussions generated new ideas about how to deal with this previously unknown illness , and identified leaders to focus on specific tasks . \n a team of individuals was asked to work with infection control colleagues to develop guidelines for icu practices considered to be high risk for sars transmission ( i.e. cardiac resuscitation , intubation , bronchoscopy , noninvasive ventilation , suctioning , high flow oxygen therapy , and high frequency ventilation ) . \n this group rapidly agreed on several recommendations , ensured the recommendations received government approval and mandates , disseminated the information on a broadly advertised website , developed instructional videos , and provided remote and local training . \n another important task was to identify , both within and outside toronto , a workforce capable of working in the icu in the event of a staffing shortage . \n finally , leaders from the icu community were appointed to deal directly with the ministry of health to bring forward ( in one voice ) critical care issues and to assist in finding system wide solutions to critical care challenges . \n other communication initiatives included a group of tertiary care intensivists making themselves available to provide 24-hour on - call clinical support and advice to any critical care provider . \n in addition , software specific to sars was developed for handheld computers and made available for broad distribution free of charge . \n finally , on a more personal level , icu leaders needed to communicate regularly with critical care staff in quarantine and those who were admitted to hospital with sars . \n at many institutions ongoing emotional support was provided to all levels of icu staff through regular meetings and psychologic intervention . \n several lessons emerged from our experience , the most important of which is the need for preparedness . we were not prepared for sars , or did we have a system - wide critical care communication strategy in place . ideally , centers should have leadership and communication systems prepared to allow for the rapid expansion and modification of critical care services in the event of a disease outbreak . fortunately \n , sars appears to have disappeared , at least temporarily , from toronto and the rest of the world . \n while we remain vigilant for a return of sars there are ongoing communication initiatives within the toronto critical care community . \n efforts related to debriefing are also ongoing . additional emotional and counseling support is being offered to those who are left with psychologic sequelae . \n finally , research initiatives continue in an effort to learn more about the events that occurred . in summary , \n other critical care communities should consider their communication strategies in advance of similar events . despite the dramatic impact of sars on our community , \n it was inspiring to witness the incredible spirit of cooperation that occurred at the local , national , and international levels . \n  \n ", 1251, 126, "arxiv"], [2, "Given a list of integers, how can you optimize the calculation of the sum of all odd numbers in the list while minimizing the memory footprint?\n\nCalculation formula:\r\n\r\nTo optimize the given function to handle large inputs while minimizing the memory footprint, the following changes can be made:\r\n\r\n1.

adaptation and monitored for avoidance behavior . \n baseline avoidance is the number of cells in our assay which show avoidance behavior when being transferred from one well containing buffer to another well containing the same buffer and usually ranges from 5 to 20% . \n cells exhibiting baseline avoidance in response to this assay were considered to be cross - adapted . \n standard one - electrode whole - cell membrane potential recordings were recorded as the previously reported procedures in tetrahymena thermophila [ 9 , 12 ] . \n the recording buffer contained were carried out in a buffer of ph 7.0 containing 10  mm trizma base , 0.5  mm mops , and 1  mm cacl2 . \n membrane potentials were displayed on a digital oscilloscope and retained on a chart recorder during continuous bath perfusion at a rate of approximately 20.0  ml / min . \n solutions were changed by switching valves connected either to buffer or to the experimental solution without changing the flow rate of the perfusion system . \n nociceptin , which has a charge of + 4 at our assay ph of 7.0 , had an ec100 of 100  m in our behavioral assay . \n nociceptin - nh2 , which has a charge of + 5 under assay conditions , had an ec100 of 50  m , while nociceptin - arg14-lys15 which has a charge of + 6 under assay conditions had an ec100 of 25  m . \n avoidance was observed for 15 seconds but was seen for as long as 1015 minutes ( not shown ) . \n cross - adaptation assays ( table 1 ) show that all three isoforms of nociceptin cross - adapt with one another . \n however , nociceptin - adapted cells did not cross - adapt to pacap-38 , and pacap - adapted cells did not cross - adapt to nociceptin . since all three nociceptin isoforms cross - adapted to one another , implying a common signaling pathway , we used 50  m nociceptin - nh2 in all subsequent pharmacological and behavioral assays . \n studies with pharmacological agents known to block g - protein signaling , tyrosine kinase signaling , and broad spectrum kinase activity had no effect on avoidance behavior in t. thermophila ( table 2 ) . however , studies with the calcium chelator , egta , and the serca atpase inhibitor , thapsigargin , both affected nociceptin avoidance ( figure 2 ) . \n a concentration of 50  m egta was sufficient to reduce avoidance to a baseline avoidance of 20% . \n thapsigargin , however , never reduced avoidance to baseline under the conditions of our assay . the highest concentration of thapsigargin we were able to achieve in our assay was 300  m . \n thapsigargin reduced avoidance by 50% at a concentration of 100  m ; however , increasing the concentration to 300  m did not decrease avoidance beyond that seen with 100  m thapsigargin . \n whole - cell electrophysiology studies indicate that nociceptin - nh2 is a depolarizing signal in t. thermophila ( figure 3 ) . \n a nociceptin - nh2 concentration of just 5  m was sufficient to elicit a depolarization of approximately 20  mv , though this concentration does not cause behavioral avoidance above baseline levels in tetrahymena ( figures 3(a ) and 1).fifty m nociceptin - nh2 , which is the ec100 for behavioral avoidance in tetrahymena , elicited a depolarization of approximately 40  mv ( figure 3(b ) ) . \n the depolarization produced by 50  m nociceptin - nh2 was eliminated by the addition of 1  mm egta to the external medium ( figure 3(c ) ) . \n j-113397 , a competitive inhibitor of the human nociceptin receptor , inhibited the behavioral response to 50  m nociceptin - nh2 in tetrahymena thermophila when applied extracellularly ( figure 4 ) . \n baseline avoidance to nociceptin was achieved by the addition of 50  m of j-113397 . \n our results confirmed our hypothesis that all three nociceptin isoforms tested would serve as chemorepellents in t. thermophila ( figure 1 ) . \n in addition , the ec100 of each compound was correlated with the charge , with the most highly charged isoform having the lowest ec100 , although all of the ec100 values were in a similar range . \n the correlation of lower ec100 values with a higher charge is consistent with what we have seen using other charged peptides in t. thermophila . \n for example , when we have used various peptides derived from acth , the more highly charged peptides caused avoidance at lower concentrations than did the less highly charged peptides . in addition , our previous studies with pacap and vip   show that pacap is effective at causing avoidance at a 1000-fold lower concentration than vip , though presumably acting through the same receptor and/or signaling pathway . \n the isoform of pacap that we used in the 2003 study , pacap-38-nh2 , has a net charge of + 11 at ph 7.0 , while vip has a net charge of just + 4 at the same ph . \n while factors other than charge are certainly involved in the interaction between these peptides and their putative receptor , it is highly probable that charge is playing a role in these interactions , possibly by increasing the affinity of ligand for its receptor . in the case of nociceptin , the charge differences were relatively small as were the differences in ec100 . \n cells acclimated to nociception within 1015 minutes of first being exposed to it ( not shown ) . \n all isoforms of nociceptin were cross - adapted to one another , indicating that all forms of nociceptin were using the same receptor and/or signaling pathway . \n this is similar to what has previously been shown for lysozyme   and pacap / vip . since pacap , lysozyme , and vip appear to share a common receptor [ 10 , 15 ] , we cross - adapted cells to nociceptin and pacap to determine whether nociceptin was using the same receptor / signaling pathway as the three previously studied polycationic ligands . \n as table 1 shows , pacap - adapted cells did not cross - adapt to nociceptin and nociceptin - adapted cells did not cross - adapt to pacap . \n this indicates that nociceptin signals through a pathway that does not involve the previously described polycation receptor . \n the previously studied pacap response appears to be mediated through a g - protein - coupled receptor which uses adenylyl cyclase , phospholipase c , and nitric oxide synthase [ 10 , 1315 ] . in order to further ascertain whether nociceptin was using a separate signaling pathway , we used pharmacological inhibitors to block g - protein - linked receptors and associated pathways . \n none of these inhibitors blocked avoidance to nociceptin ( table 2 ) , giving further evidence that the previously described polycation receptor is not being used in nociceptin signaling . \n this also differs from the vertebrate nociceptin receptor , which signals through gi / o proteins . since \n a tyrosine kinase has been implicated in gtp signaling in t. thermophila   as well as insulin signaling , we also tested a battery of protein kinase and tyrosine kinase inhibitors to determine whether nociceptin signaling would be inhibited . \n interestingly , genomic studies of tetrahymena   show no evidence of the presence of a tyrosine kinase in this organism . \n since a calcium - based depolarization is elicited by the addition of lysozyme   as well as the lysozyme fragment , cb2 , to t. thermophila , we wished to determine whether calcium was involved in nociceptin signaling in this organism . \n studies with the external calcium chelator , egta ( figure 2 ) indicated that extracellular calcium was necessary for behavioral avoidance to nociceptin , since concentrations of egta above 50  m reduced avoidance down to baseline . \n baseline avoidance in this organism is determined by counting the number of cells that show avoidance behavior when transferred from one well of buffer to another well of the same buffer . \n the serca atpase inhibitor , thapsigargin , was used to determine whether internal calcium stores were required in order for avoidance to occur . as seen in figure 2 , exposure of cells to 100  m thapsigargin reduced avoidance by approximately 50% . \n however , the avoidance response was not completely inhibited , indicating that while intracellular calcium may play a role in avoidance , lack of intracellular calcium stores depleted by thapsigargin may be partially compensated for by allowing extracellular calcium into the cytosol . \n notably , the thapsigargin concentration used in this study was much higher than what we used in a previous study , in which only 1  nm thapsigargin was necessary in order to block the behavioral response to gtp . \n calcium is not necessary for avoidance to all peptides , however , since avoidance of netrin-1 , semaphorin 3c , and fragments of acth is unaffected by addition of either egta or thapsigargin . \n whole - cell electrophysiology studies indicate that nociceptin causes a depolarization in t. thermophila ( figure 3 ) , even at concentrations that normally do not cause a behavioral response in this organism ( figures 3(a ) and 1 ) . when the ec100 of nociceptin - nh2 was used , the amplitude of the depolarization increased ( figure 3(b ) ) . \n finally , we were able to remove the depolarization by the addition of egta to the external medium ( figure 3(c ) ) , implying that calcium is involved in the depolarization . \n this is similar to the previously described responses to lysozyme   and the lysozyme fragment , cb2 . \n the involvement of calcium in nociceptin avoidance in t. thermophila is rather different from the human response to nociceptin , which involves closing calcium channels . \n however , we did use j-113397 , which is a competitive inhibitor of the human nociceptin receptor , in order to determine if it could also block t. thermophila avoidance to nociceptin . as shown in figure 4 , \n this drug had no effect on avoidance to acth fragments ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the response was specific to nociceptin . \n while we have not identified the receptor or signaling pathway that nociceptin is using in t. thermophila , these data suggest that there may be commonalities between the human nociceptin receptor and a possible nociceptin - binding protein in t. thermophila .   in summary \n , we have shown that nociceptin is a chemorepellent in tetrahymena which elicits a depolarization . \n it does not act through the previously described polycation receptor nor does it signal through a g - protein - mediated receptor like the vertebrate nociceptin receptor . \n however , the j113397 studies imply that tetrahymena may possess some type of receptor that shares binding characteristics with the human nociceptin receptor . \n further studies may help elucidate the signaling mechanisms used in nociceptin avoidance in t. thermophila . \n if the receptor is identified , comparisons between the human nociceptin receptor and the unknown nociceptin - sensing mechanism in t. thermophila would be instructive . \n the effectiveness of signaling is impacted by the charge of the nociceptin isoform , with more highly charged forms of nociceptin requiring lower concentrations to signal effectively . \n nociceptin does not signal through the previously described polycation receptor of tetrahymena thermophila nor does it signal through a g - protein - linked receptor , as it does in humans . \n however , nociceptin avoidance in tetrahymena thermophila is blocked by addition of j-113397 , a competitive inhibitor of the vertebrate nociceptin receptor . \n this suggests that the vertebrate nociceptin receptor and its analog in tetrahymena may share common binding characteristics . \n finally , nociceptin signaling provokes a depolarization , which pharmacological studies suggest may be caused by an influx of calcium .", 3817, 345, "arxiv"], [23, "Make a reasonable estimate for the current population of New York", 11, 16, "alpaca"], [24, "There are 285 sweets in the bowl.

arginine by no synthase ( nos )     [ 4 , 5 ] . \n depending on the isoform of nos catalyzing the reaction , nanomolar ( endothelial nos and neuronal nos ) or micromolar ( inducible nos ) no concentrations are produced serving as a messenger or as an antibacterial agent . \n besides eukaryotic no production , it is well known that no can be produced also by microorganisms . \n a first way of microbial no synthesis can be achieved from l - arginine by bacterial nos ( bnos ) with features resembling the eukaryotic nos ( euknos ) . \n bnos activity has been described in a group of gram - positive bacteria     [ 614 ] and genome sequencing has revealed genes coding for similar proteins that are however shorter than the euknos . \n bnos from bacillus subtilis , bacillus anthracis , deinococcus radiodurans ,   and streptomyces   spp . \n display no -

state conditions , the no concentrations range between 14 and 900 ng \n . another no producing mechanism is by the reduction of nitrite . for lactobacilli   and bifidobacteria \n hence , acidic nonenzymatic reduction of nitrite was suggested as the predominant pathway for no production in vitro by lactic acid producing bacteria ( lactobacilli   and   bifidobacteria ) as the produced organic acids decrease the ph of the agar plates to 4     . whereas no production by lactic acid bacteria was considered to be chemical , no production from nitrite by escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium was shown to be biological . \n the enzymes responsible for the no formation from nitrite in e. coli and s. typhimurium are periplasmic and cytoplasmic nitrite reductase and nitrate reductase , respectively     [ 23 , 24 ] . \n to date , the relevance and mechanism of bacterial no production under gastrointestinal conditions remain elusive . with no being produced by inducible nos in epithelial cells as a response to cytokines and bacterial products , it is of interest to know whether bacterial no production can occur under gastrointestinal conditions . \n the objective of our study was to unravel the mechanisms by which human fecal microbiota are able to produce no in vitro . \n three possible pathways were considered ( i ) l - arginine as substrate for no synthase , ( ii ) denitrification to nitrogen gas and ( iii ) dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium ( dnra ) . the latter was considered as fermentative nitrate reduction is expected under gastrointestinal conditions however no relation with no production has been considered     [ 26 , 27 ] . \n l -

n or n2o - n per l. spss version 16.0 ( spss inc . , chicago , usa ) was used to carry out all statistical analyses . \n normality of the data and homogeneity of variances was assessed using the kolmogorov - smirnov and the levene test , respectively . \n comparison of normally distributed data was performed with anova or tamhane ; when anova indicated significant differences , means were compared using the bonferroni comparison test . \n comparison of means of not normally distributed data was evaluated with the nonparametric kruskal - wallis test ; when kruskal - wallis indicated significant differences , means were compared using the mann - whitney comparison test . \n the biological production of no with l - arginine as substrate was studied by supplementing mineral medium and feed medium with 0 , 5 , or 50 mg l - arginine - n / l . \n l - arginine - n / l but not inoculated with fecal suspension , served as a negative control . \n the ph was set at 7 and no and n2o concentrations were analyzed after 24 hours . when l - arginine was supplemented to the mineral medium , only traces of no ( \n 0.28 ng no - n / l medium ) could be detected for all the l - arginine concentrations . in feed medium , \n the mean no concentration after 24 hours was for all the samples around 75 ng no - n / l medium . \n fecal suspensions were inoculated anaerobically for 24 hours in mineral media ( with succinate as electron donor ) containing 0 , 5 , or 50 mg no3-n / l . \n none of the samples contained nitrite in the beginning or at the end of the incubation and after 24 hours the mean ph was 6.53  0.35 . \n after 24 hours of incubation , the no concentrations in the mineral media remained below 1 ng no - n / l medium in all experiments ( figure 2(a ) ) . \n a proportional effect was observed for n2o production and the amount of supplied nitrate ( figure 2(b ) ) . \n however , addition of 5 and 50 mg no3-n / l resulted in significant n2o production . to examine whether microbiological production of no and n2o was possible under gastrointestinal conditions , fecal microbiota were grown in the presence of a complex medium simulating the conditions in the colon ( figure 1 ) . \n the feed medium was analyzed for nitrate and a background of 0.11 mg no3-n / l was measured . \n after 24 hours of incubation , the ph dropped to 4.13  0.05 , 4.24  0.03 and 4.47  0.03 for 0.11 , 5 and 50 mg no3-n / l , respectively . \n nitrite at time 0 was below 0.1 mg no2-n / l but after 24 hours concentrations of 0.1  0.1 and 2.0  0.2 mg no2-n / l were detected for 5 and 50 mg no3-n / l , respectively . \n figures 2(c ) and 2(d ) show the concentrations of no and n2o measured after 24 hours . the no concentration measured in the medium without nitrate addition was 37.0  0.3 ng no - n / l . \n the addition of 5 mg no3-n / l increased the no concentration slightly to 44.1  2.5 ng no - n / l medium . \n however the addition of 50 mg / l no3-n increased the no concentration drastically to 298  33 g no - n / l medium . as for the mineral media , a positive effect for the n2o production with the supplemented nitrate was observed . \n the same experimental setup as described above was used but under buffered conditions ( measured ph was always between 6 and 6.8 ) , thus avoiding fermentative acidification during biotic incubations . \n as shown in figures 2(e ) and 2(f ) , the no concentrations increased slightly when nitrate was added . \n the concentration of n2o in buffered feed medium supplemented with 5 mg no3-n / l was comparable to the concentration measured in the nonbuffered test reported above . for the highest concentration of nitrate a lower n2o concentration was detected compared to the nonbuffered test ( figure 2 ) . \n a n tracer study was used to link nitrate consumption to denitrification or dnra by the fecal microbiota under gastrointestinal conditions . \n the setup was the same as for the buffered feed medium but kno3 ( 10 atom % ) was used as n - source in 2 different concentrations , that is , 5 and 50 mg no3-n / l ( figure 1 ) . \n table 1 gives an overview of the nitrogen concentrations measured and the recovery of n after 24 hours of anaerobic incubation . \n the amount of no and n2o produced per volume of feed medium was in the same range as what was found in the buffered feed medium experiment ( table 1 ) . \n after 24 hours , concentrations reached 182  4 , 210  1 , 275  6 ,   and 50.1  2.6 mg \n no3-n / l , and the chemical control , respectively . to verify if no can be produced as a side product or as an intermediate during dnra , e. coli lmg 18221 , a strain capable of dnra but not denitrification \n after 24 hours , no concentrations of 170 ng no - n / l medium were measured . \n this no concentration was twice as high compared to no concentrations produced by the fecal cultures . \n figure 3(a ) shows that diluting the fecal suspension 200 times before inoculation in buffered feed medium results in a 75% increase in the no concentration . \n there was a difference in the no concentration related to the fecal suspension and optimal dilution . \n the optimal dilution ranged between 1/20 and 1/200 and the increase of no between 50 and 75% , respectively . \n the addition of supernatant from a fecal suspension resulted in a decrease of the no concentration ( figure 3(b ) ) . \n a continuous model that simulates the gastrointestinal tract ( shime ) was used to measure no production by human gastrointestinal microbiota . \n the no concentrations in the headspace of the 3 colon vessels were analyzed after an incubation period of 24 hours . in the colon ascendens , 101 ng \n no - n / l shime suspension was measured but lower concentrations were found in the colon transversum and descendens ( 5.4 and 8.5 ng no - n / l shime suspension , respectively ) . \n a batch setup was performed to test whether this difference was due to ( i ) the microbial community or ( ii ) the availability of nutrients in the different colon compartments . \n the biomass of the different colon compartments was washed and grown anaerobically in fresh feed medium for 24 hours . as references \n , the microbial suspensions of the different colon vessels were incubated in parallel in penicillin bottles with or without the addition of fresh feed . to exclude a chemical process , \n cell - free supernatant of the shime suspension was filtersterilized or autoclaved and subsequently incubated . \n figure 4 shows that the addition of feed increases the no concentrations at least 3 times but the difference between the first colon vessel and the other 2 was maintained . \n incubation of the washed biomass showed that even higher concentrations of no were produced ( ranging between 220 and 250 ng no - n / l ) and that the supernatant that was removed might have an inhibitory effect on the no production as observed above . \n no chemical production of no was seen when the cell - free supernatant of the shime suspension was incubated . \n our results demonstrate that the fecal microbiota of healthy persons are able to produce no in concentrations up to 90 ng no - n / l medium when grown in conditions simulating the colon ( figure 2(e ) ) . adding l - arginine to the feed medium inoculated with fecal microbiota of a healthy person had no effect on the no production . \n high amounts of nitrate in combination with low ph resulted in substantial no and n2o production ( figures 2(c ) and 2(d ) ) . \n however , no and n2o were also formed under ph buffered conditions ( figures 2(e ) and 2(f ) ) . \n these data corroborate the metabolic capacity of the fecal microbiota to reduce nitrate and produce no . by using n tracer experiments \n , it was shown that nitrate was mainly reduced to ammonium by dnra suggesting that no was produced as a side product or intermediate of this pathway . \n no was detected not only in the batch tests but also in the in vitro shime model . \n indirect evidence from in vitro studies demonstrates that extracellular l - arginine increases the no production by euknos ( at concentrations at which the enzyme should be saturated ) , known as the  l - arginine paradox      [ 37 , 38 ] and some prokaryotic nos proteins have been shown to produce no in vivo     [ 1417 ] . \n the reaction from l - arginine to no is oxygen dependent what might explain why l - arginine has no increasing effect during anaerobic growth of the fecal microbiota . \n therefore , we consider the arginine pathway for bacterial no production under gastrointestinal conditions as not important . in the lower parts of the gastrointestinal tract , nitrate originates from dietary products rich in nitrate , like spinach , beetroot , or fennel or simply from minor levels as present in drinking water . \n nitrate is reduced by the bacteria in the oral cavity or is absorbed in the small intestine . in healthy persons , levels in the order of mg no3-n / l can be estimated in the large intestine   and feces were shown to contain around 0.15 mg no3-n / l     . \n based on these data , 2 different concentrations of nitrate ( 5 and 50 mg no3-n \n very low concentrations of nitrate were measured in the feed medium receiving no additional nitrate ( 110 \n 50 g   no3-n / l ) , representative for the concentrations found in feces . \n no3-n / l very high concentrations of no ( 29.8 g no - n / l ) were measured . during the incubations , the ph dropped to a mean value of 4.24 due to the accumulation of organic acids produced by the microorganisms . at these low ph values , a chemical reduction of nitrite to no ( ph below 5.5 ) can not be excluded     . in vivo , \n the ph increases over the different colon parts . considering a ph of 6.37  0.58 in the colon ascendens , 6.61  0.83 in the colon transversum and 7.04  0.67 in the colon descendens , \n a chemical reduction of nitrite to no in vivo is not likely . because it was unclear whether no was produced chemically or biologically \n the very high no concentrations produced at low ph in feed medium containing the highest nitrate concentration   were not found at neutral ph . in a study of sobko \n the production of no by fecal microbiota cultivated on iso - sensitest agar supplemented with nitrate was demonstrated . for the plates supplemented with 1.4 mg \n no3-n / l , concentrations in the range 293600 ppbv no , corresponding to 1145 ng no - n / l in the microbial suspension , were measured but a high variability was seen between different fecal samples . as the ph of the plates decreased from 7 to 5 , a chemical reduction could not be excluded . \n however , it was concluded that the fecal no generation was not solely due to acidification of the plates     . \n we can conclude that the no concentrations found in our study , which were between 90 and 100 ng no / l for low concentrations of nitrate , are in the same order of magnitude . under anaerobic conditions \n , bacteria can use nitrate as n - source in nitrate assimilation and 2 dissimilatory processes , denitrification and dnra . \n denitrification is assumed to be the major nitrate removal pathway in many anoxic ecosystems like soils , sediments , and water treatment plants   but information about the occurrence of this process in the human colon is limited . \n denitrifying bacteria are found in alpha- , beta , gamma- and epsilonproteobacteria , firmicutes , and bacteroidetes . during denitrification no is produced in the nanomolar range , without reaching toxic levels     [ 21 , 22 ] . \n when the supply of electron acceptor is limited , it is more beneficial for the bacteria to exploit dnra rather than denitrification because of the higher electron consumption . \n molecular and biochemical studies have described dnra in some enteric bacteria      but information about the occurrence of this process in complex microbial cultures including the microbiota of the human gastrointestinal tract is limited . \n allison and macfarlane   reported that dnra is the major pathway for nitrate reduction by the fecal microbiota . \n identification based on phenotype and genotype showed that clostridium ramosum , bacteroides vulgates , and the enterobacteriaceae were mainly capable of dnra . \n these species are representative for the dominant groups of the fecal microbiota     [ 31 , 32 ] . by adding the stable isotope \n n in the form of nitrate , the occurrence of all nitrate - reducing processes under gastrointestinal conditions was studied and quantified . \n high ammonium concentrations in the medium repress nitrate assimilation and enhance the use of nitrate for the dissimilatory processes . under gastrointestinal conditions \n nitrate seems to be completely reduced to ammonium and not to n2 gas and during this reductive process , no is produced in low concentrations . to our knowledge , \n further proof for no production during dnra was given by e. coli   k12 , a strain capable of dnra but not denitrification ( data not shown ) . \n this strain produced 170 ng no - n / l under gastrointestinal conditions with low concentrations of nitrate ( 110 g   no3-n / l ) . \n evidence for no as an intermediate in dnra would be even more decisive when n - no was measured during the n tracer study . \n however , equipment for n - no analyses is very specialized      and not in the scope of this paper . whether n2o is an intermediate as well or \n the reduction product of a defense mechanism of bacteria to no   is not clear . \n the gaseous no concentration measured in the colon ascendens ( ca ) vessel of the in vitro shime model was around 15 times higher than the no concentrations measured in the colon transversum ( ct ) and colon descendens ( cd ) . during \n the batch experiments incubation of the microbial suspension from the different colon vessels showed that the no concentration of the ca doubled when adding fresh medium . \n the addition of fresh feed medium decreased the difference in no concentrations between the colon vessels . remarkably , \n when removing the supernatant of the suspension , a 6-fold increase of no was seen and the difference between the colon vessels disappeared , indicating that the availability of nutrients rather than a difference in the microbial community was responsible for the differences between the colon vessels . \n also , a similar inhibitory effect was seen by adding the supernatant of the fecal suspension to the inoculated buffered feed medium . diluting the fecal suspension to increase \n no production confirmed our observation . a possible explanation for this inhibitory effect can be the presence of bile salts . about 5% of the bile salts secreted in the duodenum is available to the microbiota in the colon . to protect them , \n the microbiota tend to hydrolyze the bile salts but around 5% of the nonconverted bile salts can be found in human feces and will have toxic effects on the bacteria     . \n diluting the fecal suspension could decrease the toxic effect and thus increase the bacterial metabolism . \n the same explanation might be valid for the lower no concentrations in the nonbuffered compared to the buffered feed medium for the 2 lower concentrations of nitrate . as the ph drops during the nonbuffered incubations , \n the metabolism of the bacteria might be suppressed leading to a lower formation of no . \n epithelial cells are known to produce no through oxidation of l - arginine by nos     [ 4 , 5 ] . \n although bacterial origin was considered , the no was believed to originate from the mucosa . \n several years later , no concentrations were measured in the rectum that was not cleared from luminal bacteria and again no concentrations in patients with active ibd were elevated . \n our results corroborate that the fecal microbiota actively produce substantial levels of no , even from traces of nitrate . in vitro the fecal microbiota \n no no was found in the rectum of healthy volunteers but 40 ng no - n / l was measured in the rectum of patients with active ibd     . \n externally added no ( in the form of gas or no donor ) has been shown to alter the mucosal barrier function     [ 4749 ] and to have an effect on the metabolism of colonocytes . as it was strongly suggested that several constitutive and/or inducible defense systems exist in mammalian cells that neutralize the damaging effects of no \n , the high rectal levels of no in ibd patients and the low levels in healthy persons might indicate that the expression of these defense mechanisms in ibd patients is ineffective . in this work , \n the human fecal microbiota were shown to produce no from trace levels of nitrate under gastrointestinal conditions . moreover , our data indicate that no was produced by dnra and not by denitrification or the l - arginine pathway . \n studying the interaction between bacterially produced no and the host epithelial cells might be pivotal in the etiology of inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract .", 6977, 222, "arxiv"], [109, "John decides to install a ramp in his house.

item scale quantifying the severity of the swallowing disorder . \n when considering the criterion validity , the mdadi and the dhi showed satisfactory associations with the swal - qol after having removed its less relevant subscales . considering both the mdadi and the dhi , it is concluded that neither of these two questionnaires will generate perfect psychometric data . \n while striving to use questionnaires with the most optimal properties , the ultimate choice will be made by future researchers themselves . \n depending on the purposes of their studies , they may choose the somewhat elaborate swal - qol or one of the other two questionnaires with reasonable ( though not perfect ) psychometric characteristics . \n in conclusion , when assessing the validity and reliability of the dutch version of the mdadi and the dhi , not all criteria for psychometric properties have been adequately met . in general , the importance of determining these characteristics and of objectifying concepts such as validity and reliability must be stressed when developing a questionnaire . \n if a questionnaire s quality proves to be poor , the study results can not be interpreted correctly nor can any clinical relevance be determined . \n therefore , it is recommended that future outcome studies should use only quality - of - life questionnaires that have sufficiently good psychometric characteristics .", 9739, 381, "arxiv"], [30, "Write a function that calculates the Fibonacci numbers to the nth number, ensuring that the function runs in O(n) time complexity.", 25, 291, "codegen"], [31, "Write a summary of the product features in a single sentence.\n\nThis product is a facial recognition software that uses camera and deep learning technology to accurately detect and recognize objects in photos.", 35, 24, "alpaca"], [139, "Format this text according to APA style.\n\nComputer science is the study of how computers work and how they can be used to solve problems.", 27, 28, "alpaca"], [80, "Brooke is milking cows and then selling the milk at the market for $3 a gallon.

12 ] . \n large arrays of periodically ordered microtubes can be fabricated by a combination of lithography and deliberate self - rolling of strained layers upon selective underetching [ 1,13 - 15 ] . \n however , in some cases , it might be important to stimulate tube formation in certain areas and suppress tube formation outside those areas . \n precise control over the lateral positioning and the number of windings is fundamental for the use of the tubes in optical resonators for sensors [ 16 - 20 ] , hyperlenses , or electrical transport ( curved electron gases ) [ 23 - 27 ] . \n numerous existing studies offer highly sophisticated methods for precise lateral positioning of rolled - up semiconductor nanostructures by controlling the starting edges [ 13 - 15,28,29 ] , but difficulties arise for thin layers due to the extensive , successive lithography steps involved , and ways to control the stopping point of rolling remain largely lacking without modifying the structure . here , we demonstrate illumination - controlled hydrofluoric acid ( hf ) etching of a buried thin alas sacrificial layer . \n sufficiently intense light exposure of a certain substrate area leads to a complete suppression of the underetching effect , and as a result , the formation of rolled - up ingaas / gaas tubes can be easily controlled spatially . \n this method allows for control over the roll - up stopping point and is suitable for very thin sacrificial layers . \n the aim of this study was to quantify the observed  etch - suppression effect \n ( ese ) and precisely control the release of ingaas / gaas bilayers with an illumination technique . \n v rolled - up nanotube ( runt ) : when immersed in hf solution , the compressively strained double layer ( a gaas layer on top of a larger - lattice constant inxga1x as layer deposited pseudomorphically on a gaas substrate with an alas sacrificial layer ) releases from the substrate as the sacrificial layer is preferentially removed by the hf at a previously defined starting edge and begins to roll up in order to relax the built - in strain gradient . \n finally , the bent bilayer forms a tube or scroll after performing a full rotation . \n the starting edge , which for ingaas / gaas layers should be oriented in the   direction for optimal structural integrity of the resulting runts , can be defined either by scratching the surface , thereby laterally exposing the sacrificial layer , or by opening a window through the entire layer structure by photolithography and subsequent wet chemical etching . \n the tube diameter , i.e. , the size of the cross section of the structure obtained after the etching step has been completed , depends on the thickness and inherent strain of the layers , and can be accurately varied in the nano- to micrometer range [ 1,30 -

resistant trough for etching with hf under light focused by a zeiss optical microscope using different objective lenses of 5  through 50  magnification ( for sample evolution during this process , see fig . \n other measurements were performed using illumination from a hene laser with maximum output power of 2 mw , as well as a laser with adjustable power ( up to 20 mw ) and wavelength ( 535825 nm ) with focusing optics or an optical fiber to illuminate the surface of the sample . \n for all measurements , the intensity of illumination was measured beforehand using a calibrated power meter . for samples that were etched , illuminated , and observed under the microscope , \n the settings on the illumination dial were used and the focused spot sizes for each magnification were assumed to be the same . for the quantitative measurements of tube rolling distance , optical images of the sample outside of solution once the etching was terminated were taken . from these images , the rolling distance could then be measured , which we define as distance from the starting edge to the center of the tube width , assumed to correspond to the stopping point of the underetching . the resolution of the es method was studied by precisely positioning the illumination spot on wet - chemically etched mesa structures of different shapes and sizes ( on the order of 10100 m ) during hf etching . \n the degree of etching suppression ( given by the coverage area of unetched structures remaining on the sample ) was measured versus distance from the center of illumination . \n figure 1b shows an optical microscopy image of a structure composed of a 4 nm alas layer and a 40 nm symmetrical strained in0.33ga0.66as / gaas bilayer . \n the larger circular shape observed on the sample at the end of the hf experiment is formed by original mesa structures that were left unetched , while on the rest of the sample the bilayer mesas are underetched , leading to rolling up as expected . \n figure 2 , which plots the average rolling distance as a function of intensity for structures with varying alas thickness , illustrates the sudden onset of the ese . \n the error due to variations in experimental parameters such as quantity of hf solution , scattering of light and effective illumination intensity at the sample , as well as the method for evaluating rolling distances , is estimated to be within 15% . \n it can be seen that the maximum rolling distance increases as the alas thickness increases , while the ese is only present for sacrificial layers below 10 nm . moreover , the onset of the ese , or the intensity of illumination necessary to suppress the alas etching , is higher for larger thicknesses . \n onset of illumination effect for 20 nm ingaas/20 nm gaas samples with 4 , 7 , 10 , 12 , 13 , 15 , and 20 nm alas sacrificial layers , etched with 2.5% hf solution using 20  microscope objective , for 8 min ; the starting edges were produced by mechanical scratching . \n the diamond data point shows a maximum rolling distance previously reported   figure 3 shows the maximum rolling distance as a function of the sacrificial layer thickness . in a regime from 5 nm up to a thickness of 15 nm of alas the relationship between the maximum rolling distance and the sacrificial layer thickness is approximately linear , and then saturates for thicker alas layers . \n although in previous studies   ingaas -

up layer and the substrate or inside the etching solution caused by the process in the gap between the substrate and the rolled - up film . the second regime shows a clear saturation behavior for alas thickness larger than 15 nm . in this regime , the saturation should be dominated by intrinsic effects either from the layer system itself or possibly by some kind of fundamental process yet to be found . \n the linear scaling of the maximum rolling distance offers the possibility for lateral positioning of the rolled -

hf reaction rate as well as the physical characteristics of the structure : the larger the sacrificial layer gap and faster the reaction rate , the higher the intensity of illumination needed to suppress the etching . \n this trend continues up to a point where the reaction is no longer illumination dependent and suppression is no longer possible . \n a further series of experiments involving etching with filtered light and a focused laser beam of varying wavelengths ( not presented here ) suggests that the ese is preserved for lower energies than the alas band gap and therefore any photochemical effect in hf can not depend on light excitation of the alas material . \n we have also eliminated the possibility that heating plays a significant role in the ese , since experiments that involve heating samples in hf solution past the boiling point show an enhancement rather than suppression of the etching and hence would counteract this effect . \n we believe that for the ese found in samples etched with hf for shorter times under illumination levels close to the threshold value from fig . \n 2 , the strained bilayer remains intact because the sacrificial layer was not underetched at the starting edge , which may happen through the accumulation of solid as and as oxide following from a photochemical interaction at the gaas surface in the presence of hf . \n the process through which alas sacrificial layers are wet - etched with hydrofluoric acid ( hf ) [ 34 - 43 ] as well as the laser - induced etching of semiconductors by a dilute acid solution [ 44 - 46 ] have been investigated previously in some depth . in hf - alas reactions , \n any passivating as formed at the surface is usually oxidized and then dissolved , thus allowing new access to the etch front and sustaining etching . \n but if the rate of as production exceeds that of oxide formation , or if the type of oxide is stable in the hf , then the etching will be inhibited . from laser - induced etching studies , it is clear that porous stable oxide films formed at the semiconductor surface give a time dependence for the process . during the redox reaction , as(iii ) \n must be complexed by water and dissolved as haso2 and as2o3 , but when the concentration of as(iii ) surpasses the solubility limit , there is precipitation of as at the surface , slowing down the reaction . \n our results match well with this type of process , and we propose that the ese occurs in a similar fashion : the formation of very small amounts of as or as2o3 at the alas gap , which would nonetheless be enough to block access of hf to films under 10 nm , can effectively suppress the underetching of the alas layer . in accordance with our findings , the thicker the sacrificial layer gap and the faster the hf etching rate , the less likely the ese takes place . in the suppression regime for thinner alas layers , for higher intensities of illumination the photogeneration of holes is more pronounced leading to a faster subsequent passivation ( and reaching of the ese limit with time ) . for thicker alas layers , higher illumination can still lead to changes at the gaas substrate interface   but does not hinder the etching of the alas . \n while the self - limitation of the maximum rolling distance of runts allows for the precise tuning of the number of rotations as a function of the sacrificial layer , the illumination permits the exact positioning of the tube in combination with common lithographic technology . \n fine - tuning the etch suppression with patterned samples can yield a useful way of precisely controlling the roll up of strained ingaas / gaas bilayers and the entire tube fabrication process , as well as other more general laser - assisted microfabrication applications , with a convenient , customizable method . in this way , it is complementary to pre - pattering of the sample by lithographic means and allows for a full control over the position of the produced runts . \n ", 5115, 180, "arxiv"], [50, "Code a function to clamp a given number between a minimum value and maximum value.

test . \n on \n the other hand , it is easy to interpret that the expected percent of differences between \n double readings bigger than meansd is approximately 37% for radiographs and \n approximately 27% for models . \n in the study of repeatability , neither the correlation coefficient nor the regression \n analysis is appropriate . the standard deviation dahlberg ( 1946 ) \n gives in his textbook can be used only when \n readings are independent and identically distributed random variables and differences \n between readings are on average zero , which is not the case in cephalometric \n investigations . in clinical practice , \n when double readings are taken , a t - test should be carried out for \n testing whether differences between double readings are on average zero or there is a \n systematic error . \n standard deviation is of course a measure of dispersion ( or , \n inversely , precision ) and so is the coefficient of repeatability , but a control chart \n should also be used for detecting outliers . \n measurements made in out -

reviewed and discussed with health care professionals working within paediatric wards and also was pilot - tested on random patients ' relatives at the hospital over a 1-week period to evaluate the language used , to verify the relevance of the questions , and for clarity and consistency . \n it focused on basic demographic data ( age and gender ) , education , and questions about their knowledge regarding giardiasis , mode of transmission , organ affected , its suggestive signs and symptoms , prevention , most reliable method of diagnosis , and whether giardiasis was a curable disease . \n additionally , caregivers were also assessed about from which sources and channels they would like to receive information on giardiasis . \n answers were categorized into either correct ( if matching the medically correct answer ) or incorrect . \n all consecutive parents / carers who fulfilled the eligibility criteria for inclusion and who agreed to participate were recruited if they were either new attenders or reattending . \n respondents were adult members of patients ' families ( parents / carers ) who visited the outpatient clinic of aphch for gastrointestinal problems . \n after the interviewers , who were three of the research team authors ( y. salazar , m. alfonso , and i. v. dawkins ) , explained the purpose of the study and obtained individual verbal consent from the respondents , they administered the questionnaire to parents / carers , while waiting for the consultation of their child . \n the interviews were conducted in private to maintain confidentiality and to reduce the influence of relations of peers . \n verbal informed consent was obtained from the study participants before the research instruments were administered . \n confidentiality of all information obtained from participants was maintained by not allowing information to be accessible to nonmembers of the research team . \n database was prepared using epi info version 6.0 , and accordingly data entry was done . \n frequency distributions were obtained . in the exploration of possible associations between respondent characteristics and awareness about transmission and prevention , \n analysis was done taking into account education of respondents , which was categorized into two categories ( less than 12 years of formal education or 12 years of formal education ) and age of respondents ( less than 40 year of age and 40 years of age ) . \n crude odds ratio ( or ) , their 95% confidence intervals ( cis ) and p values were calculated with  set at 0.05 . \n of the 202 caregivers interviewed , 177 ( 87.6% ) were females and 25 ( 12.4% ) were males . \n a substantial proportion of caregivers , 157 ( 77.7% ) , had received 12 years of formal education or more , and 128 ( 63.3% ) were employed outside home . \n of the 202 caregivers , more than half ( 72.7% ) considered that giardiasis is a modern problem , and , although almost half ( 47.5% ) stated that this disease could not lead to death , 39.1% did , and 13.4% did not know . \n small intestine was correctly identified as the site of giardiasis by 125 ( 61.9% ) of the caregivers . however , more than one organ was mentioned as a possible target of giardia infection including gallbladder ( 66 ( 32.7% ) ) and liver ( 54 ( 26.7% ) ) . for 127 ( 62.9% ) of respondents those who harbour giardia infection \n thirty - two ( 15.8% ) of the respondents did not have knowledge about the signs and symptoms of giardiasis . \n those having knowledge mentioned abdominal pain ( 77.6% ) , diarrhoea ( 70.6% ) , and loss of weight 59.4% as the symptoms of giardiasis . \n however , other clinical manifestations including hives , itching , spots in the skin , and tiredness were mentioned for more than 30% ( table 1 ) . \n the majority of caregivers , 171 ( 84.6% ) , considered the microscopy of duodenal aspirate as the most effective diagnostic tool for giardiasis . \n the microscopy of faecal smears was only cited by 18 ( 8.9% ) respondents ( table 1 ) . \n one hundred and sixty - nine caregivers ( 83.6% ) in this study knew that giardia could be transmitted through drinking unboiled water and unwashed vegetables and fruits intake . \n the other modes of transmission mentioned by interviewees were walking barefoot and using utensils previously used by patients with giardiasis ( table 2 ) . \n those with an education of 12 years of formal education or more were four times more likely to be aware of prevention than those with less than 12 years of education ( or = 4.5 , 95% ci = 1.910.8 ) . \n interaction between knowledge of transmission and age was tested and found to have no significance ( table 3 ) . nearly all caregivers ( 95.5% ) \n almost all the respondents 175 ( 86.3% ) considered giardiasis to be preventable , most of them ( 169 ( 83.6% ) ) believe that prevention could be achieved by drinking boiled water , washing hands , and washing vegetables and fruits ; 86.3% , 89.6% , and 91.5% , respectively . \n other actions including avoiding walking barefoot and avoiding utensils used by patients with giardiasis were also mentioned by a group of them ( table 5 ) . \n those with an education of 12 years of formal education or more were nearly three times more likely to be aware of prevention than those with less than 12 years of education ( or = 2.8 , 95% ci = 1.35.9 ) . \n no significant association was observed between knowledge of prevention and age ( table 5 ) . \n one hundred and fifty - nine of the caregivers stated that they did not receive information on giardiasis during the last year from any source or channel . \n caregivers were asked which methods they would prefer to know or to improve their knowledge about giardiasis . among the suggested sources and channels , television was mentioned by 130 ( 64.3% ) , nurses and medical doctors 107 ( 52.9% ) , printed materials  leaflets , posters , and pamphlets94 ( 46.5% ) , and radio 35 ( 17.3% ) . \n the goals of treating symptomatic giardiasis properly are to minimize the duration of illness , ensure cure , stop transmission of infection , and could also be to prevent the emergence of drug resistance . \n caregivers ' input , as in other areas of medicine involving children , seems to be critical to clinical management in paediatric giardiasis . \n the importance of providing caregivers with appropriate information is to enable them to participate effectively in giardiasis recognition , and preventative measures should be recognized . \n even when there were some important gaps in various issues , it was encouraging to observe that in most issues caregivers ' perceptions on giardiasis closely paralleled that of the biomedical understanding . \n this coincidence should be used as an entry point for a broader he activity , which is then expanded to also accommodate other disease aspects , that is , its mode of transmission , signs and symptoms , and appropriate prevention methods , to provide accurate and complete knowledge on giardiasis . \n internationally , this disease is gaining increasing attention , first as a reemerging infectious disease in industrialized countries and , second , as a part of the  neglected disease initiative  by the world health organization . \n its diagnosis has been established progressively with improving sanitation and with fading of the role of fatal epidemic infections as the overwhelming everyday problem . \n these , together with the fact that in cuba high prevalences have been reported among young children attending day - care centres and primary schools [ 7 , 8 ] , might be justifying the perception held by most respondents that this disease is a modern problem . \n additionally , giardia has also been frequently isolated from faeces of cuban children with diarrhoea , and it seems to be a common cause of children hospitalization [ 11 , 12 , 16 ] . these could have led some caregivers to conclude that this disease could cause death . \n giardia organisms primarily affect the proximal small intestine ; however , during the last decades , there have been various reports concerning other localizations of giardia trophozoites including gallbladder , urinary tract , gastric mucosa [ 1921 ] , colonic and ileal mucosa [ 22 , 23 ] , and pancreas . \n the majority of caregivers were able to recognize that giardia infection is frequently asymptomatic , and diarrhoea and abdominal pain are the clinical manifestations of symptomatic giardiasis . \n this is probably due to the educational message in the mass media stating that two of the primary clinical features of symptomatic intestinal parasitic diseases are diarrhoea and abdominal pain . \n this could be of importance , taking into account that an early treatment  in some aspects  could depend upon prompt recognition of symptoms and signs of giardiasis in the household , mainly by caregivers . \n it was surprising because , although this sign has been reported associated with giardiasis in the scientific literature [ 2528 ] , it is not so common . \n considering the frequent asymptomatic nature of this infection and the high prevalence of this protozoan worldwide , urticaria most of the times indicates that it is necessary to look for an alternative diagnosis . \n nevertheless , it should be stated that , coincidently , in a survey of knowledge , perceptions and practices about giardiasis in 63 gastroenterologist of havana , it was evidenced that 55.6% of these specialists in havana stated that this parasitic infection was a frequent cause of cutaneous manifestations . \n the intermittent excretion of giardia cysts might be affecting the perceptions of the microscopic study of faecal specimens which for most of the caregivers considered useless . at the same time \n two studies on knowledge and practices on giardiasis among gastroenterologist and dermatologists in havana showed that 52.4% of gastroenterologists   and 64% of dermatologist   considered that duodenal aspiration was the best way to diagnose this parasitic disease . \n certainly , duodenal aspirate is a valuable diagnostic aid for avoiding delays in diagnosis and prolongation of patient morbidity . \n however , this situation could be counterproductive because other parasitologic diagnoses  potentially causing disease \n . however , there were some important gaps concerning these two issues which indicate that people today tend to combine all of the general preventive measures against intestinal parasitic infections , maybe , as a reflection of a result of previous activities directed at intestinal parasites control . \n additionally , there exists a link between hygiene and infection , which is a common theme in the lay literature , and caregivers could be able to make connections and draw inferences from previous similar experiences . \n g. lamblia remains the leading waterborne diarrhoea - causing disease [ 31 , 32 ] , either when people drink accidentally or swallow water from contaminated or untreated sources ( no heat inactivation , filtration , or chemical disinfection ) . \n the correct treatment of water and food and hand hygiene ( i.e. , hand washing with soap and water or the use of a waterless , alcohol - based hand rub ) are considered the most important measures in preventing infections transmitted via the faecal - oral route . \n it has been recently shown in a systematic review the impact of interventions to improve hand washing with soap in the community could reduce diarrhoea risk by 47% . in the usa , an outbreak of giardiasis , involving multiple modes of transmission , eventually stopped , possibly influenced by a vigorous hand washing campaign .   in the present study , \n the higher educational level of the caregivers had a positive influence on the knowledge of transmission and prevention of giardiasis . \n the parents ' educational level is one of the factors of health inequalities among children . \n education is important for health because of the opportunities it creates to obtain better material living conditions ; well - educated people are less likely to be unemployed , and more likely to have full - time jobs , fulfilling work , and high income \n . a good example could be a study carried out in peru where participants with greater wealth indexes were associated with protection against giardia and persistent giardia infections ( > 14 days ) . in a study carried out in portugal , \n children with mothers without any education were more likely to be infected with giardia than those with educated mothers . \n similarly , children living with fathers with no education had a 12.26 times higher risk of being infected with giardia than those with educated fathers . \n this highlights the need for giardiasis he programmes and material targeted at groups with special needs . even in a country like cuba , where the educational level is very high , \n groups still exist where low education and thus higher risk of diseases , such as giardiasis , may interact to create an unfavourable situation . \n to target populations for prevention messages , it is important to know which sources and channels of information are most frequently reported as being used to keep informed about a specific topic . consistent with a previous study , it was found that television was the preferred channel of information , followed closely behind by their medical doctors , and printed materials . \n he materials such as posters and brochures may be an effective way to disseminate health information , providing such information in the local language that could be displayed at prominent places , such as health facilities and community centres . at present , \n access to culturally appropriate and easy - to - understand educational materials on giardiasis is lacking . based on this study \n , it may be recommended that he materials oriented towards increasing the knowledge in different issues of giardiasis should be developed . \n the case group and their mothers were separately covered by the he programmes that included washing hands with soap , cutting nails , washing vegetables , and making the families knowledgeable about giardiasis and its effects on their children . \n all the programmes were performed by he methods , that is , poster , video film , face - to - face meetings , and pamphlets . \n three months later , a triple stool examination was done in both groups to check reinfection . \n after the implementation of the programmes , the mean of the mother 's awareness about controlling of giardiasis increased from 6.54% to 27.16% ( p = 0.00001 ) , without any variation in the control group in this item . \n the mean of children 's information about giardiasis and its methods of control in the case and control groups before implementation of the he programmes was 4.76% and 4.86% , respectively , but after the implementation of the programs , it increased to 16.3% in the case group but remained at 4.86% in the control group ( p = 0.00001 ) . \n after implementation of he programs , the rate was 23.3% in the case group but 86.7% in the control group , indicating a significant difference between the two groups . \n the interpersonal communication , which is the most effective method of communicating health information , that takes place in the doctor 's offices and the waiting room may offer the opportunity for physicians and other health care professionals to display their potential to play a significant role in promoting individual patient action and contributing to the development of social norms concerning health behaviour . \n health care workers ( medical doctors and nurses ) occupy a position of high credibility and trust which make their pronouncement well received ; they have a well - recognized role encouraging prevention . \n however , as key communicators , they need the necessary skills to carry out activities that allow discussions , feedback , and explanation to the target audience . in the cuban context , some studies carried out among gastroenterologist , and dermatologists have evidenced the necessity of improving the giardiasis management and prevention information they provide to their patients [ 29 , 30 ] . this might be a fruitful area for future health intervention campaigns . \n study participants were restricted to caregivers who were recruited from only one health facility , and , therefore , their views may be biased by contact with the same paediatric gastroenterology team and their standard educational practices . \n participants were recruited among parents / carers attending to the hospital ( a majority resided in havana ) , and thus we likely failed to capture the views of people in other provinces . as parents were recruited from those taking their children to the outpatient clinic for gastroenterology and within population are likely to be a large group of children who have giardiasis , it is reasonable to assume that parents of these children are more likely to know what giardiasis is than parents from the general population . \n additionally , it should be noted that people attending health facilities at a hospital are expected to have a relatively greater awareness about common health issues . \n there is not a previous study in this area , and hence this questionnaire survey was the first to explore some of the issues in detail . \n face - to - face administration of the questionnaire might have led to some degree of bias in the interviewees ' responses . \n the study has revealed reasonable knowledge of the symptoms of giardiasis ; however , there is a need for educational intervention directed towards correcting misconceptions . \n there was a need for an effective education programme focusing on giardiasis transmission and prevention which should be emphasised in order to avoid reinfections . \n the central necessity of caregivers ' involvement in developing educational strategies that reflect their understandings and interpretations of this disease should not be overlooked .", 4666, 288, "arxiv"], [53, "Please help me complete the long-text summarization task, where the long text is 'input' and the summarized result is 'output'.\n\nthe input is: protein lysine methyltransferases \n ( pkmts , also known as histone \n lysine methyltransferases ( hkmts ) ) catalyze the transfer of the methyl \n group from the cofactor s - adenosyl - l - methionine \n ( sam ) to lysine residues of histone and non - histone substrates , leading \n to lysine mono- , di- , and/or trimethylation . \n histone lysine \n methylation has been increasingly recognized as a major epigenetic \n gene regulation mechanism in eukaryotic cells . \n therefore , pkmts as a class of potential drug targets have received \n considerable attention from the medicinal chemistry and chemical biology \n community . with the exception of dot1l , \n pkmts contain an evolutionarily \n conserved set ( su(var ) , e(z ) , and trithorax ) domain . \n this catalytic \n domain consists of a substrate binding groove and a cofactor binding \n site . \n a number of selective small - molecule \n inhibitors of pkmts including g9a / glp , ezh2 , smyd2 , dot1l , and setd2 \n have been discovered . \n these inhibitors are competitive with either the peptide substrate \n or the cofactor sam . in addition , a number of selective inhibitors \n of protein arginine methyltransferases ( prmts ) , another class of protein \n methyltransferases , have been reported . \n some of these inhibitors \n have subsequently been utilized as valuable tools for investigating \n the role of the corresponding methyltransferases in various human \n diseases . \n setd8 ( also known as set8 , \n pr - set7 , or kmt5a ( lysine methyltransferase \n 5a ) ) is the sole methyltransferase that catalyzes monomethylation \n of histone h4 lysine 20 ( h4k20 ) . \n setd8 and h4k20me ( h4k20 \n monomethylation ) have been implicated in regulating a diverse set \n of biological processes including the dna damage response , dna replication , \n and mitotic condensation . \n a recent study \n has shown that ( 1 ) setd8 is physically associated with twist , a master \n regulator of emt ( epithelial  mesenchymal transition ) , ( 2 ) setd8 \n and twist are functionally interdependent on promoting emt , ( 3 ) setd8 \n acts on the promoters of the twist target genes such as n - cadherin via exertion of its h4k20 monomethylation activity , and ( 4 ) setd8 \n expression is positively correlated with metastasis and the expression \n of twist and n - cadherin in breast cancer cells . \n in addition to h4k20 , setd8 methylates many \n non - histone substrates including the tumor suppressor p53 and proliferating \n cell nuclear antigen ( pcna ) . \n the monomethylation \n of p53 at lysine 382 ( p53k382me1 ) catalyzed by setd8 suppresses p53-mediated \n transcription activation of highly responsive target genes . \n the monomethylation of pcna \n at lysine 248 ( pcnak248me1 ) catalyzed by setd8 stabilizes pcna protein , \n enhances the interaction between pcna and the flap endonuclease fen1 , \n and promotes the proliferation of cancer cells \n to date , nahuoic \n acid a , a marine natural product , is the only known selective inhibitor \n of setd8 ( figure 1 ) . \n this inhibitor is competitive with the cofactor sam and noncompetitive \n with the peptide substrate . here \n we report the discovery of unc0379 \n ( 1 ) , the first substrate - competitive inhibitor of setd8 . \n compound 1 is a synthetic small - molecule inhibitor that \n displays inhibitory activity in multiple biochemical assays and is \n selective for setd8 over 15 other methyltransferases . \n the binding \n affinity of compound 1 to setd8 was determined using \n biophysical assays such as itc ( isothermal titration calorimetry ) \n and spr ( surface plasmon resonance ) and is largely consistent with \n its potency in biochemical assays . \n we describe hit identification , \n analogue synthesis , structure  activity relationship ( sar ) findings , \n and comprehensive characterization of compound 1 in a \n number of biochemical and biophysical assays including mechanism of \n action and selectivity studies . \n we previously reported that 2,4-diaminoquinazolines \n are selective , \n substrate - competitive inhibitors of the lysine methyltransferases \n g9a and glp . to identify a substrate - competitive inhibitor of \n setd8 \n , we cross - screened our quinazoline - based inhibitor set , which \n consists of > 150 compounds , against setd8 . from this study \n , we \n discovered \n compound 1 as an inhibitor of setd8 ( figure 2 ) . \n interestingly , compound 1 was originally \n prepared for targeting l3mbtl1 , a methyllysine reader protein , but showed no appreciable activity for l3mbtl1 . \n on the other hand , \n compound 1 displayed inhibitory activity \n with an ic50 of 7.3  1.0 m ( n = 2 ) in a radioactive biochemical assay that measures the transfer \n of the tritiated methyl group from h - sam to a peptide \n substrate catalyzed by setd8 ( figure 2 ) . \n the \n inhibitory activity of compound 1 was confirmed in an \n orthogonal biochemical assay , microfluidic capillary electrophoresis \n ( mce ) assay . \n this setd8 mce assay was developed analogously to the \n previously reported g9a mce assay . \n compound 1 was identified as an inhibitor of setd8 \n by cross - screening a quinazoline - based inhibitor set . \n ( a ) structure \n of compound 1 . ( b ) concentration  response curve \n of compound 1 in the setd8 radioactive methyl transfer \n assay . to determine sar for this promising \n hit , we designed and synthesized a number of analogues that contain \n various 2- and 4-substituents at the quinazoline core . \n we synthesized \n compounds 124 from commercially \n available 2,4-dichloro-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline and corresponding \n amines in good yields ( scheme 1 and tables 1 and 2 ) . using the methods \n developed previously , we displaced the \n 4-chloro group with the first set of amines at room temperature and \n the 2-chloro group with the second set of amines under microwave heating \n conditions to yield the desired 2,4-diamino-6,7-dimethoxyquinazolines . \n ( a ) r amines , thf , n , n - diisopropylethylamine , room temperature ; \n ( b ) r amines , n - buoh , dipea , microwave , \n 160 c . \n the synthesized compounds \n were then evaluated in the setd8 radioactive methyl transfer assay . \n ic50 values of these compounds in this biochemical assay \n are summarized in tables 1 and 2 . \n we first explored the 4-amino group of the quinazoline scaffold \n ( table 1 ) . reducing \n the length of the alkyl \n linker between the two amino groups resulted in the decrease of the \n potency ( compound 1 versus compounds 24 ) . \n the distal amino group can be changed from the pyrrolidinyl \n to piperidinyl or dimethylamino without any potency loss ( compound 1 versus compounds 5 and 6 ) . \n interestingly , \n the diethylamino analogue ( compound 7 ) was somewhat less \n potent than compounds 1 , 5 , and 6 . \n we also attempted to replace the piperidinyl group with a piperazinyl \n or n - substituted piperazinyl group ( compound 1 versus \n compounds 812 ) . \n however , these structural \n modifications led to a potency loss , suggesting that an additional \n basic amino group ( compounds 912 ) or a large substituent ( compound 8) is detrimental \n to inhibiting setd8 . \n in addition , we found that the basicity of the \n pyrrolidinyl group in compound 1 was an important contributor \n to its setd8 inhibitory activity , as the corresponding amide analogue \n ( compound 13 ) was about 8-fold less potent than compound 1 . \n we also explored whether the nh group in compound 1 was potentially engaged in a hydrogen bond interaction and \n found that the n - methyl analogue ( compound 14 ) was drastically less potent than compound 1 , suggesting that the hydrogen of the secondary amine likely serves \n as a hydrogen bond donor . \n we next explored the 2-amino group of the quinazoline scaffold \n ( table 2 ) . \n the replacement of the pyrrolidinyl \n group with either the piperidinyl or azepanyl group resulted in a \n significant loss of the potency ( compound 1 versus compounds 15 and 16 ) , suggesting a large group is disfavored . \n on the other hand , \n the dimethylamino group ( compound 17 ) did not lead to any significant potency loss . \n the introduction \n of an additional basic amino group ( compound 15 versus \n the unsubstituted piperazinyl analogue 18 and the n - methylpiperazinyl analogue 19 ) resulted in \n a complete loss of the potency . \n we also explored other amino groups \n such as n - methyl - n - cyclopentylamine \n ( compound 20 ) and n - methyl - n - cyclohexylamine ( compound 21 ) . compared with compound 1 , compounds \n interestingly , removing the methyl group from \n either compound 20 or 21 led to the complete \n loss of inhibitory activity ( compounds 22 and 23 ) , suggesting that tertiary amino groups are preferred compared with \n secondary amino groups . \n taken together , these results suggest that \n setd8 inhibitory activity is very sensitive to the 2-substituent . \n compound 1 bound setd8 with a kd of 18.3  \n 3.2 m ( n = 3 ) ( figure 3 ) . in spr studies , compound 1 behaved as a classic reversible \n inhibitor with a fast on rate ( ka = 2.18 \n  0.36  10 1/ms ) and a fast off rate ( kd = 7.82  0.87  10 1/s ) ( figure 4 ) . \n the kd of compound 1 was determined to be 36.0  \n 2.3 m ( n = 3 ) . \n the binding affinity of compound 1 to setd8 determined by itc and spr is largely consistent \n with its potency in the biochemical assays . \n compound 1 binds setd8 with a kd of 18.3  \n 3.2 m ( n = 3 ) in itc \n studies . \n we \n next studied the moa ( mechanism of action ) \n of the setd8 inhibition by compound 1 via varying concentrations \n of the h4 peptide substrate or the cofactor sam . \n as illustrated in \n figure 5a , ic50 values of compound 1 increased linearly with h4 peptide concentrations . on the \n other hand , \n ic50 values of compound 1 remained \n constant in the presence of increasing concentrations of sam ( figure 5b ) . \n these results indicate that compound 1 is competitive with the peptide substrate and noncompetitive with \n the cofactor sam . \n ( a ) compound 1 is competitive with the peptide substrate , as its ic50 values increased linearly with h4 peptide concentrations . \n ( b ) compound 1 is noncompetitive with the cofactor sam , \n as its ic50 values remained constant in the presence of \n increasing concentrations \n of sam . to confirm the findings \n from the moa studies , we tested compound 1 and an inactive \n control ( compound 14 ) in a peptide displacement assay \n using fluorescence polarization ( fp ) , which measures effects of inhibitors \n on displacing the h4k20me ( 124 ) peptide with n - terminus labeled \n by fluorescein isothiocyanate ( fitc ) . \n as illustrated in figure 6 , compound 1 effectively displaced \n the fitc - labeled peptide binding to setd8 with an ic50 of \n 37.7  7.2 m ( n = 2 ) . \n on the other hand , \n our negative control ( compound 14 ) did not displace the \n peptide in this fp assay . \n compound 1 effectively \n displaced the fitc - labeled h4k20me ( 114 ) peptide , while an \n inactive control ( compound 14 ) did not . \n we next determined the \n selectivity of inhibitor 1 for setd8 over 15 other methyltransferases \n ( figure 7 ) . with the exception of prc2 ( polycomb \n repressive \n complex 2 ) , the ic50 values of compound 1 for \n 14 other methyltransferases including g9a and glp were all above 100 \n m . \n for prc2 , compound 1 was active only at the \n two highest concentrations ( 50 and 100 m ) with an estimated \n ic50 value greater than 50 m . \n we discovered the first selective , substrate \n competitive inhibitor \n of setd8 by cross - screening our quinazoline - based epigenetic library . \n our sar studies of this series reveal that while the 4-amino moiety \n can be modified without a significant loss of potency , modifications \n to the 2-amino moiety are not well tolerated . \n we characterized compound 1 in a battery of biochemical , biophysical , moa , and selectivity \n assays and found that the setd8 inhibitory activity of this compound \n in biochemical assays was largely consistent with its binding affinity \n to setd8 determined by itc and spr . \n our moa studies indicate that \n this inhibitor is competitive with the peptide substrate and noncompetitive \n with the cofactor sam . \n this moa was further supported by our finding \n that compound 1 effectively displaced the fitc -

There is an \u201cinsurance game\u201d that plays a part in the lives of almost all of us with back pain, and the game is fixed . . . against us. One of our goals in doing this book is to cut you loose from its tangles\u2014because insurance today is structured to push you to do repetitive and ultimately useless fixes (not cures), and it sometimes it pushes you in the wrong (read \u201cdangerous\u201d) direction. \nMost insurers are not wonderfully straight in their dealings with certain aspects of back pain. I am not talking so much here about medical events; they are a little different. I am talking about the use of therapists and other healers, whom so many of you spend so much on. \nHere is the problem. Most insurers pay for some therapeutic treatment of back pain, but the payments (like most therapies and therapists) are focused on fixes, not cures. For example, insurers pay (about $50 a treatment) for a chiropractor to do an \u201cadjustment\u201d of your back (i.e., he or she will \u201cpop\u201d your back with a high-velocity treatment of the spine or joint). A little bit of history may help here. It was once believed that when chiropractors did high-velocity treatments (i.e., \u201cpopped\u201d your spine), they were actually straightening out a \u201ckink.\u201d That is, you had somehow \u201cthrown out\u201d your back, and the chiropractor, God bless him, straightened it out again. Sounded great and, sure enough, you got some relief. Alas, that\u2019s not usually what happens, and the relief was temporary.\nWhen chiropractors \u201cpop\u201d your back with the application of high-velocity manipulation (and there often is a pop), what they really are doing, in most cases, is restoring range of motion to a joint and/or releasing a muscle spasm. That pop you hear is the release of gases that build up in the joint. Restoring range of motion and releasing a spasm is a blessed relief, often enough, but it has nothing to do with curing the condition that caused the spasm in the first place. So, absent any further instructions from the therapist about behavior change, we are talking a purely palliative step. \nBut most insurers see additional chiropractic treatment (e.g., instruction about exercise and other behavior), which might really do some good, as just an incidental \u201cadd-on\u201d and pay only some $10 a patient for it. For most chiropractors that won\u2019t pay the bills. Better for them to do a bunch of adjustments (or pops) and give their patients blessed relief and stay in business to help their patients another day. So even assuming that the chiropractor knows how to address serious back pain for the long haul, he or she is not really compensated to try. \nThe story is similarly wrong-headed but a little different with physical therapists. Therapists are paid to do exercise, but the payment model almost assures that they go at it in a way that is not as useful as it could be. Basically, insurers will pay for treating only functional limitations. That means things like being unable to sleep, turn over in bed, put on your clothes. Beyond that, you are on your own. You can\u2019t ski or jog or play with the kids? Tough . . . not covered. And your back still hurts like crazy all the time? Still no insurance. Insurance pays for only the minimum level of functionality. Therapists are not paid to analyze how you got in this jam in the first place, they are not paid to teach you how to avoid future incidents, and they are not paid to set you on a course of serious strength training of the kind that we talk about in this book, which is the only thing that is likely to effect a permanent cure, even assuming that they know how to do so. \nTo make things worse, many of the outcome measures mandated by insurers (to determine whether you have been returned to the minimal level of functionality) are outdated and even dangerous. In particular, the insurers often place great emphasis on range of motion of the lumbar spine. In Jeremy\u2019s view, this is the least important measure of change in most cases and may be counterproductive. The goal of sound treatment is not a more flexible lower spine; it is teaching the patient stability. So measuring recovery in terms of the flexibility of the lumbar spine is usually wrong. And urges you\u2014and your practitioner\u2014to try to do things you should not be doing. \nAlmost all medical doctors, chiropractors, and physical therapists got into the business because they wanted to help people. I hope this short chapter shows that when treating back pain, the financial deck is often stacked against them. That should change.", 996, 357, "sharegpt"], [59, "Please help me complete the long-text summarization task, where the long text is 'input' and the summarized result is 'output'.\n\nthe input is: he had begun to experience visual problems 8 months earlier , which rapidly deteriorated in the last 2 months . \n fifteen months later , metastatic disease was discovered in his sternum and he received iodine-131 therapy . \n his visual acuity was light perception in the right eye and 20 / 25 in the left eye . \n microcystic corneal edema , a fixed and dilated pupil , and rubeosis iridis were found in the right eye . \n there was total serous retinal detachment and the intraocular pressure was 45 mmhg ( applanation ) . \n ocular ultrasonography demonstrated a single choroidal lesion with a basal diameter measuring 11 mm and a thickness of 6 mm in the right eye ( fig . \n the right eye was enucleated , as there were no prospects of recovering useful vision . \n a dark , well - encapsulated scleral nodule was noted over the enucleated globe ( fig . \n a month later , the patient 's visual acuity in the left eye decreased to 20 / 200 with the new development of a solitary , reddish - pink choroidal mass that measured 6  4.5 mm in basal dimensions and 1.5 mm in thickness , superior to the fovea and within the temporal vascular arcades ( fig . \n this tumor was treated with a single session of transpupillary thermotherapy using a 0.5 mm spot size , 500 mw power , and 29 overlapping spots each lasting 45 seconds . \n six weeks later , the tumor in the left eye totally disappeared without any improvement in the patient 's visual acuity ( fig . \n evidence for widespread metastatic involvement of the lungs was confirmed a month later and he expired from respiratory complications . \n histopathological examination of the eye revealed that the choroidal tumor was composed of papillary excrescences and cystic spaces ( fig . \n the sclera was eroded in full thickness and tumor cells gained access into the sub - tenon 's space . \n hematogenous distant metastases occur in only 10% of patients , mainly to the lungs , bones , and brain . \n ocular metastasis is distinctly unusual and when present , the orbit is more commonly affected than the intraocular tissues . \n uveal metastatic thyroid carcinoma was found in patients who had their primary cancer diagnosed and treated for an average of 9.9 years ( range , 4 to 30 years ) [ 4 - 9 ] . in 2 cases , \n reported ocular signs and symptoms included a sudden loss of visual acuity , loss of color discrimination , visual field defects , and light flashes [ 3 - 9 ] . \n the majority of these patients had a solitary , amelanotic , orange - yellow choroidal mass sometimes associated with serous or hemorrhagic retinal detachment [ 3 - 7,9 ] . \n extraocular extension , very similar to our case , was found only once , in a blind and painful eye . because a very limited numbers of patients have been reported , no data exist describing the best and most effective treatment of this condition . \n external beam radiotherapy , i ablation therapy and enucleation have been employed based on the extent of the tumor , the potential for visual improvement and the systemic status of the patient [ 3 - 9 ] . in our patient , \n transpupillary thermotherapy resulted in satisfactory regression of the solitary choroidal metastatic tumor in the left eye .", 766, 291, "arxiv"], [60, "Return a new array after removing duplicates from a given array.

properties   and applications , mostly as tunable emitters for biomedical labeling , light emitting diodes ( led ) , lasers , and sensors [ 3 - 5 ] . \n however , wide band gap semiconductor nanocrystals , such as zinc chalcogenide ones doped with transition metal ions [ 6,7,9 - 11 ] , may overcome this concern and yet maintain the advantages of the nanocrystal emitters . in 1994 , bhargava et al . \n initiatively proposed luminescence properties of mn - doped zns nanocrystals that were prepared by a room temperature chemical process . \n then , nanocrystalline zns has been widely and deeply investigated   since nanosized zns can be easily prepared . as a typical ii \n vi semiconductor , zns , especially doped with divalent manganese ions , has been commercially used as a phosphor as well as in thin film electroluminescent devices . in the bulk form \n vi semiconductor with a large band gap 3.68 ev ( 340 nm ) . at the nanometer scale , \n zns has attracted more attention due to its interesting optical , electric properties , and large quantum efficiencies depending on its size . \n for instance , it can be used as a higher band gap material to passivate other quantum semiconductor heterostructure to increase their quantum yields . \n the properties of the photoluminescent and electroluminescent materials could be greatly affected by doping concentration of mn . \n the mn ion , used as a dopant in many luminescent materials , has a d configuration that exhibits a broad emission peak , and its position strongly depends on the host lattice , which lies on the change in strength of crystal field with host . \n the emission color can vary from green to deep red , corresponding to a t1a1 transition . to obtain nanometer - sized particles , \n a variety of methods have been proposed , including microemulsion method , sol  gel processing , competitive reaction chemistry method , and aqueous chemical method . since dixit et al \n water(a / w ) solution , there have been few reports on generating of nano - crystallined ceo2 and silicon in a / w mixed solvents   or in ethylalcohol liquid bridges . in this paper , we focus on preparation of stabilized mn - doped zns nanocrystals by soft template method and coated zn(oh)2 shells through precipitation reaction . \n photoenhanced luminescence and higher quantum efficiency have been observed in zns : mn / zn(oh)2 nanoparticle . \n zn(ch3coo)22h2o(a.r . ) , na2s9h2o(a.r . ) , and mn(ch3coo)24h2o(a.r . ) were employed as raw materials and c2h5oh and h2o mixed solution as soft template . \n first , na2s and dopant precursor mn(ch3coo)2 were ground in mortar to form mns crystal nucleus , and c2h5oh and h2o solutions were added as soft template in grinding process . \n then , zn(ch3coo)2 was added and ground in soft template for the regrowth of zns on the surface of mns layer . \n the concentration of the dopant in the nuclei can be regulated varying the precursor ratio . \n the products were collected by centrifugal sedimentation and first washed by ionized water then by alcohol . \n finally , the products were ultrasonically dispersed in alcohol and dried at 40c in vacuum . \n zn(oh)2 shell , coating on zns : mn nanocrystals can be produced as follows : zns : mn nanocrystal was put into deionized water and ultrasonically dispersed for 2 h. appropriate amount of zn(ch3coo)2 aqueous solution was slowly dropped into the zns : mn suspension under the conditions of vigorous stirring . \n ten minutes later , appropriate amount of naoh aqueous solution was dropped into the suspension to form stoichiometric zn(oh)2 . \n after 1 h of continuous stirring , the resulting precipitates were dealt in the same way as the zns : mn nanocrystals . \n all the samples were characterized by powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) using a rigaku diffractometer with ni - filtered cuka radiation at room temperature . \n the transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) images of the nanoparticles were obtained by using tem ( jem-2100f electron microscope / jeol co. 200 kv ) . \n the optical properties of finely ground samples were collected by an uv  vis spectrophotometer ( pe

xe 900 ( 450 w xenon arc lamp ) as the light source with spectral slits width of 1 nm . the quantum yield of the samples excited at 300 nm was recorded with horiba jobin - yvon fluorlog-3 spectrofluorometer system . \n the xrd patterns of the zns : mn nanocrystals prepared in the condition of alcohol and water volume ratio of 1:1 are presented in fig \n . 1 . the broadening of the diffraction peaks of all the mn : zns nanoparticles , a characteristic of nanocrystal , can be obviously observed . \n for all the samples , the main three diffraction peak positions correspond to the lattice planes of ( 111 ) , ( 220 ) , and ( 311 ) , matching the cubic zinc blende zns structure ( jcpds no . 05 - 0566 ) . \n scherrer formula , the mean crystalline sizes calculated from the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of these lines were about 3.02 nm . xrd patterns of zns : mn nanocrystals ( a / w = 1:1 ) this paper extends the method employing the a / w template to produce the zns : mn nanocrystals . \n the nanocrystals distribute in a narrow size ; the shape of the particles is approximately spherical , and the mean diameter is about 35 nm . the nucleus formation mechanism in alcohol and water system is as follows : the reagents are over saturation in a / w template , and the relationship between super saturation and the radius of stable nuclei ( r ) can be expressed by kelvin equation : tem image of zns : mn nanocrystals ( a / w = 1:1 ) the degree of super saturation ( s ) is defined by the ratio of solute concentration ( c ) and saturation concentration ( c1 ) : when the s value is much larger than unity , a great number of primary nuclei formed . according to , the dependence of particle radius ( r ) on the dielectric constant (  ) of the solution can be further simplified as where 0 is the permittivity in vacuum and  is the dielectric constant in a given solution . \n the symbols r+ and r represent the radii of ions charged z+ and z , respectively , and e represents the elementary charge ( e = 1.602  10 c ) . for mixed solvents of homologous alcohol and water system , values of a and b \n therefore , it is clear that the change in the dielectric constant of mixed solvent can remarkably affect the nucleation rate and the particle size . \n in addition , for single water system , due to the small particle size there is a big specific surface area , so the products easily aggregate . \n because alcohol and water can dissolve each other unlimitedly , most of water molecules adsorbing on the particle surface can be replaced by alcohol molecules , which diminish the particle surface tension and surface energy ; thus , the trend of reunion between the particles can be effectively declined . besides , the probability of collisions between particles can be reduced by the steric effect of organic system ( a / w ) , which contributes to the formation of nanoparticles with uniformity and good dispersion . \n figure 3 illustrates photoluminescence ( pl ) spectra of zns : mn nanocrystals with different mn concentration excited at 300 nm in the room temperature . \n the pl spectrum shows a weak emission at 430 nm and a broad strong emission band ranging from 520 to 700 nm . \n the weak blue - light emission at 430 nm is attributed to a defect related emission of the zns host . \n the orange broad emission centering at 605 nm ascribes to the transition of mn from the first excited state of t1 to the ground state of a1 . \n the origin of typical emission of mn is as follows : when mn ions are incorporated into the zns lattice and substitute for host cation sites ; the hybrid between the sp electrons of the host zns and the d electrons of mn occurs and makes the forbidden transition of t1a1 partially allowed , as a result of the characteristic emission of mn . \n it is observed that the strong pl position from zns : mn nanocrystals compared with other results   redshifts to 605 nm ( fig . \n a possible explanation is that the enhancement of quantum effect in nanocrystals increases the hybrid effect , according to tanabe - sugano cryatal field theory of transition metal , t1 energy in first excited state of mn decreases with the increase in crystal field intensity , but ground state a1 is not changed , so the shrunken gap between t1 and a1 causes a pl red shift . \n the emission spectra of zns : mn nanocrystals for different mn concentrations ( inset is the intensity of emission as a function of mn concentration ) the doped manganese in the precursors may be introduced into inside or outside of zns nanocrystals . \n they found that whether mn incorporates into the zns lattice will lead to the orange emission , while zns with mn on the surface - bound will yield the ultraviolet emission . \n narayan pradhan studied the possible nucleation and growth process , they found that the successful doping and decoupling of doping must fulfill following conditions : with the increase in doped ions , the steady increase in the pl intensity from the doping centers at about 605 nm , the fixed pl positions of the host zns nanocrystals and the doping centers , and the gradual decrease in the pl intensity of the host zns nanocrystals . \n 3 demonstrates the functional relation between characteristic emission intensity of mn and doping amount . according to inset of fig . \n 3 , with the increase in mn , the emission intensity also increases and reaches its highest intensity at the mn content of 2% . at the same time , \n therefore , the mn precursor would be much less than zn if they both have the same carboxylate ligand . from above all \n , it can be concluded that the mn ions in our samples are indeed introduced into the host zns nanocrystals . from the fig . \n 3 , the highest doping amount is 2% . at the same time , the amount of alcohol will affect the degree of agglomeration of nanoparticles . according to dlvo theory , \n the energy barrier between two particles that inhibits agglomeration can be expressed as : where a is the effective hamaker constant , k is the debye  huckel parameter , r is the particle diameter , r is the relative dielectric constant of the liquid medium , 0 is the dielectric constant of vacuum , and   is the surface potential . the dielectric constant of an a / w mixed solvent decreases with an increase in the volume ratio of a / w . in this study \n , we kept the total a / w volume as a constant then adjusted the alcohol ratio in the template and investigated the effects of the alcohol volume on the pl properties . \n mn concentration is fixed at 2% , the pl spectra of nanocrystals with various s are shown in fig . \n the emission intensity of zns : mn enhances gradually with the increase in alcohol concentration . because of the integrity of a better particle namely passivated surface defect , the strongest emission could be obtained when the concentration of alcohol reached 33% ( alcohol and water volume ratio of 1:2 , inset of fig . \n the emission spectra of zns : mn nanocrystals for different a / w volume ratio ( inset is the intensity of emission as a function of alcohol content in template ) according to the results , we draw a conclusion from the process of preparing nanocrystals that the function of a / w mixed system is as follows : at that moment , the hydrogen bonds , hydration , and ethanol  water molecules are no longer separate water molecules or ethanol molecules but bridged molecular clusters formed by a number of ethanol molecules and water molecules . \n it is deduced that there are three possible cluster structures : five ethanol molecules and six water molecules connect with each other to form a ring or chain structure through the hydrogen bond ; an ethanol molecule and two water molecules form the chain structure with hydrogen bond ; and an ethanol molecule and five water molecules link mutually to form a new molecular structure . \n when the solution has a 60% ( vol ) of ethanol , the concentration of the first component cluster arrives at the maximum , the second and third types of the component cluster are , respectively , correspond to the alcohol concentration of 40 and 80% . from experiment results \n , it could be inferred that in the course of obtaining integrated particle crystallization , the second cluster structure is the best template , because our sample with best emission intensity was produced in the condition of the closest approach to the second type molecular structure of alcohol ( 40%).the optimal volume of a / w is 1:2 . \n optical absorption spectra of zns : mn nanocrystals for different a / w are shown in fig . \n the excitonic absorption peaks for all these samples are blueshifted in the comparison with the bulk band gap ( 3.68 ev corresponding to the absorption edge at 336 nm ) . \n it is clearly indicated the strong quantum size effects , and they have nearly the same particle size . according to the effective mass model , the radius of the particle is related to the absorption band . \n the bandgap energy of nanocrystals as a function of their size is given by the brus equation , the absorption spectra of zns : mn nanocrystals for different a / w volume ratio in the case of zns , using a gap eg ( bulk ) = 3.68 ev , an effective mass for electrons me and holes mh = 0.61 m0(m0 is the electron mass ) and a dielectric constant r = 8.9 , the following relation between the bandgap eg ( r ) , in electron volt , and the particle radius r , in nanometers , is obtained : r was calculated ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 nm ( a diameter from 3 to 5 nm ) , in reasonable agreement with the xrd results . due to the sample synthesized in a / w volume ratio of 1:2 \n has the highest emission intensity and lowest absorption intensity ( figs . 4 , 5 ) \n , we can draw a conclusion that in our samples , this one has the best quantum efficiency , then we made surface treatment on this sample to improve its emission intensity and measure the quantum efficiency . \n that is coated with a layer of zn(oh)2 on the surface of zns : mn . \n figure 6 is the tem image of zns : mn coated with zn(oh)2 in a / w volume ratio of 1:2 and electron diffraction in the inset ( right ) , while inset ( left ) is the image of bare zns : mn nanoparticle . \n the results indicate that zns : mn / zn(oh)2 nanoparticles with high distribution , and no aggregation was synthesized successfully . \n tem shows the presence of zn(oh)2 coating layer on the surface of the zns : mn . \n it is found that the emission intensity of coated sample enhanced by 30% . it is proven that the zns : mn surface had been modified by zn(oh)2 layer . \n ( a ) is the scatter spectra and ( b ) is the emission spectra of samples . \n the quantum efficiency can be calculated by following formula : , where ec is the emission of sample , ea is the emission of integrating sphere , la is the scatter of integrating sphere , and lc is the scatter of sample , and after deducting the error of attenuating plate , the results are shown in table 1 . from table 1 , we find that the absolute quantum efficiency enhanced by 2.3% ( from 8.4% of uncoated sample to 10.7% of coated sample ) . based on the results , it is concluded that zn(oh)2 layer can passivate the surface of bare zns : mn to improve the emission intensity and quantum efficiency . tem image of zns : mn / zn(oh)2 nanocrystals ( inset of left ( a / w = 1:2 ) is bare zns : mn and right is electron diffraction pattern of zns : mn / zn(oh)2 ) the emission spectra of zns : mn and zns : mn / zn(oh)2 nanocrystals the schematic representation of quantum efficiency measurement quantum efficiency results luminescent decay curves and their fitting curves are shown in fig \n curves a , b , and c , respectively , represent the samples synthesized under conditions of a / w volume ratio of 1:1 , 1:2 , and coated with a layer of zn(oh)2 with mn - doped concentration of 2% . because the mn ions in zns host are insular luminescent centers , the decay is evidently required a multiexponential function , which is shown through the solid smooth line from the data . where , 1 is the lifetime of luminescence ( at 1 , the intensity decays to e of its original intensity ) . \n it can be found that shorter luminescent lifetime is fulfilled when a / w volume ratio is 1:2 with respect to 1:1 . \n as nonradiative recombination centers , recombination rate of the surface mn ions is very fast . \n once the number of the surface mn ions is reduced by the zn(oh)2 shell , the nonradiative transition paths will be blocked to some extent , leading to the lengthen of the luminescence decay . \n the xrd patterns of the zns : mn nanocrystals prepared in the condition of alcohol

volume on the pl properties . \n mn concentration is fixed at 2% , the pl spectra of nanocrystals with various s are shown in fig . \n the emission intensity of zns : mn enhances gradually with the increase in alcohol concentration . because of the integrity of a better particle namely passivated surface defect , the strongest emission could be obtained when the concentration of alcohol reached 33% ( alcohol and water volume ratio of 1:2 , inset of fig . \n the emission spectra of zns : mn nanocrystals for different a / w volume ratio ( inset is the intensity of emission as a function of alcohol content in template ) according to the results , we draw a conclusion from the process of preparing nanocrystals that the function of a / w mixed system is as follows : at that moment , the hydrogen bonds , hydration , and ethanol  water molecules are no longer separate water molecules or ethanol molecules but bridged molecular clusters formed by a number of ethanol molecules and water molecules . \n it is deduced that there are three possible cluster structures : five ethanol molecules and six water molecules connect with each other to form a ring or chain structure through the hydrogen bond ; an ethanol molecule and two water molecules form the chain structure with hydrogen bond ; and an ethanol molecule and five water molecules link mutually to form a new molecular structure . \n when the solution has a 60% ( vol ) of ethanol , the concentration of the first component cluster arrives at the maximum , the second and third types of the component cluster are , respectively , correspond to the alcohol concentration of 40 and 80% . from experiment results \n , it could be inferred that in the course of obtaining integrated particle crystallization , the second cluster structure is the best template , because our sample with best emission intensity was produced in the condition of the closest approach to the second type molecular structure of alcohol ( 40%).the optimal volume of a / w is 1:2 . \n optical absorption spectra of zns : mn nanocrystals for different a / w are shown in fig . \n the excitonic absorption peaks for all these samples are blueshifted in the comparison with the bulk band gap ( 3.68 ev corresponding to the absorption edge at 336 nm ) . \n it is clearly indicated the strong quantum size effects , and they have nearly the same particle size . according to the effective mass model , the radius of the particle is related to the absorption band . \n the bandgap energy of nanocrystals as a function of their size is given by the brus equation , the absorption spectra of zns : mn nanocrystals for different a / w volume ratio in the case of zns , using a gap eg ( bulk ) = 3.68 ev , an effective mass for electrons me and holes mh = 0.61 m0(m0 is the electron mass ) and a dielectric constant r = 8.9 , the following relation between the bandgap eg ( r ) , in electron volt , and the particle radius r , in nanometers , is obtained : r was calculated ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 nm ( a diameter from 3 to 5 nm ) , in reasonable agreement with the xrd results . \n due to the sample synthesized in a / w volume ratio of 1:2 has the highest emission intensity and lowest absorption intensity ( figs . 4 , 5 ) \n , we can draw a conclusion that in our samples , this one has the best quantum efficiency , then we made surface treatment on this sample to improve its emission intensity and measure the quantum efficiency . \n that is coated with a layer of zn(oh)2 on the surface of zns : mn . \n figure 6 is the tem image of zns : mn coated with zn(oh)2 in a / w volume ratio of 1:2 and electron diffraction in the inset ( right ) , while inset ( left ) is the image of bare zns : mn nanoparticle . \n the results indicate that zns : mn / zn(oh)2 nanoparticles with high distribution , and no aggregation was synthesized successfully . \n tem shows the presence of zn(oh)2 coating layer on the surface of the zns : mn . \n it is found that the emission intensity of coated sample enhanced by 30% . it is proven that the zns : mn surface had been modified by zn(oh)2 layer . \n ( a ) is the scatter spectra and ( b ) is the emission spectra of samples . \n the quantum efficiency can be calculated by following formula : , where ec is the emission of sample , ea is the emission of integrating sphere , la is the scatter of integrating sphere , and lc is the scatter of sample , and after deducting the error of attenuating plate , the results are shown in table 1 . from table 1 , we find that the absolute quantum efficiency enhanced by 2.3% ( from 8.4% of uncoated sample to 10.7% of coated sample ) . based on the results , it is concluded that zn(oh)2 layer can passivate the surface of bare zns : mn to improve the emission intensity and quantum efficiency . tem image of zns : mn / zn(oh)2 nanocrystals ( inset of left ( a / w = 1:2 ) is bare zns : mn and right is electron diffraction pattern of zns : mn / zn(oh)2 ) the emission spectra of zns : mn and zns : mn / zn(oh)2 nanocrystals the schematic representation of quantum efficiency measurement quantum efficiency results luminescent decay curves and their fitting curves are shown in fig . \n 9 . curves a , b , and c , respectively , represent the samples synthesized under conditions of a / w volume ratio of 1:1 , 1:2 , and coated with a layer of zn(oh)2 with mn - doped concentration of 2% . \n because the mn ions in zns host are insular luminescent centers , the decay is evidently required a multiexponential function , which is shown through the solid smooth line from the data . \n where , 1 is the lifetime of luminescence ( at 1 , the intensity decays to e of its original intensity ) . \n it can be found that shorter luminescent lifetime is fulfilled when a / w volume ratio is 1:2 with respect to 1:1 . \n sample coated with zn(oh)2 shell leads to the increased lifetime . as nonradiative recombination centers , \n once the number of the surface mn ions is reduced by the zn(oh)2 shell , the nonradiative transition paths will be blocked to some extent , leading to the lengthen of the luminescence decay . \n in summary , zns : mn and zns : mn / zn(oh)2 nanocrystals were synthesized by soft template and precipitation reaction method . \n as the mn concentration increased , the emission intensity increases and reaches highest with the mn content at 2% . \n meanwhile , the emission intensity varies with the ratio of alcohol . when alcohol and water volume ratio is 1:2 , the strongest emission intensity and shortest lifetime decay is achieved , which is attributed to the integrity of better particle getting from structure of alcohol / water template . \n when zns : mn is coated with zn(oh)2 , the emission intensity of mn enhances by 30% , and its absolute quantum efficiency increases by 2.3% . \n this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china ( 10874061 ) and research fund for the doctoral

The ground control station can display the live video feed from the drone's camera, as well as data from its sensors, such as temperature, humidity, and air quality.\n\nTo accomplish this, we can modify the code for the ground control station to include a module for receiving and displaying data from the drone's sensors and camera. This can be achieved using a variety of software tools and libraries, such as OpenCV and Pygame, which are commonly used for computer vision and graphical user interface (GUI) development.\n\nHere's an example code snippet for displaying the live video feed from the drone's camera in the ground control station:\n```python\nimport cv2\n\n# initialize camera capture object\ncap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)\n\n# create window for displaying video feed\ncv2.namedWindow('Drone Camera Feed', cv2.WINDOW_NORMAL)\n\nwhile True:\n    # read frame from camera capture object\n    ret, frame = cap.read()\n    \n    # display frame in window\n    cv2.imshow('Drone Camera Feed', frame)\n    \n    # check for key press to exit program\n    if cv2.waitKey(1) == 27:\n        break\n\n# release camera capture object and destroy window\ncap.release()\ncv2.destroyAllWindows()\n```\nThis code initializes a camera capture object and creates a window for displaying the live video feed from the drone's camera. It then enters a loop to continuously read frames from the camera capture object and display them in the window. The loop also checks for a key press to exit the program.\n\nWe can further modify this code to include additional modules for receiving and displaying data from the drone's sensors, such as temperature and humidity.

hexane extract ( 0.327  g / g dry copra ) of copra was higher than the aqueous extract ( 0.116  g / g dry copra ) , possibly due to higher solubility of the copra in n - hexane . \n the yield of coconut copra oil by soxhlet assembly was 3.581  g / g dry copra . \n the color of aqueous extracts was found to be milky - white , while the n - hexane extract was pale yellow . \n although the aqueous extract had a sweet odor , the n - hexane extract was odorless . \n the soxhlet extracted oil and commercial oil were both light yellow in color with typical characteristic coconut odors . \n the physicochemical properties of copra oil showed no significant differences between specific gravities of commercial oil ( 0.92  0.01 ) and soxhlet extracted oil ( 0.90  0.01 ; p = 0.0700 ) , % ffa ( commercial oil : 0.08  0.02 , and soxhlet extracted oil : 0.18  0.02 oil ; p = 0.3450 ) , and lovibond color indices ( commercial oil : 5.17  0.28 , and soxhlet extracted oil : 5.67  0.29 ; p = 0.1010 ) ( table 2 ) . \n these observations showed that the method of extraction of oil from coconut copra ( either expeller pressed or soxhlet ) did not significantly affect the specific gravity , ffa , and color of the oils . \n however , significant differences were obtained in viscosities of the oils at 23  2c ( commercial oil : 0.04  0.02  pas , soxhlet extracted oil : 0.03    0.02  pas ;  p = 0.0110 ) , peroxide values ( commercial oil : 2.89  0.30 meq./kg oil , soxhlet extracted oil : 4.64    0.44 meq./kg oil ; p = 0.0049 ) , p -

anisidine values were obtained in soxhlet extracted oil than in the commercial oil , indicating higher primary and secondary oxidation of oil during soxhlet extraction . \n higher peroxide and p - anisidine values contributed to higher totox values , which represents total oxidation of oil as was true for the soxhlet extracted oil . from table 3 , we observe that the aqueous extract consisted of glycosides ( in moderate intensity ) and resins , saponins , and alkaloids ( in low intensities ) . \n flavonoids , tannins , steroids , terpenoids , and acidic compounds were absent in this extract , while the n - hexane extract contained glycosides ( in moderate intensity ) , with low intensity of alkaloids , saponins , and resin ( table 4 ) . \n these glycosides had been coextracted from copra during aqueous and solvent extractions and in the oils during soxhlet extraction and expeller pressing . \n these were detected as red precipitates of moderate intensities using fehling 's solutions a and b. our observations were in agreement with those of odenigbo and otisi , who also reported glycosides in moderate to high intensities in aqueous and n - hexane extracts of nigerian coconuts . \n tannins , steroids , flavonoids , terpenoids , and acidic compounds were absent in both the extracts . \n we observed that saponins and glycosides were present in moderate intensity and alkaloids and resins in low intensity in both the oils . \n however , flavonoids , tannins , steroids , terpenoids , and acidic compounds were absent in the oils ( table 5 ) . \n overall , our observations showed that flavonoids , tannins , steroids , terpenoids , and acidic compounds were absent both in the extracts and in the oils . \n our observations were in agreement with those obtained in the aqueous and n - hexane extracts of coconuts of nigeria , wherein presence of alkaloids , glycosides , saponins , and resins has been reported by odenigbo and otisi . \n these authors have also reported absence of flavonoids in both aqueous and solvent extracts , in agreement with our study . however , in contrast to the same report , we did not find tannins and terpenoids in the extracts . \n the absence of acidic compounds in either extract was in agreement with previous researchers [ 6 , 17 ] . since alkaloids , glycosides , and saponins were found to be present in medium - low ranges , we did not attempt to quantify the same . \n the phytochemical analyses of copra extracts and oils ( table 6 ) showed highest antioxidant activity in commercial oil ( ic50  0.04  0.01  mg / ml ) followed by that in the soxhlet extracted oil ( ic50  0.09  0.01  mg / ml ) , aqueous extract ( ic50  1.96  0.14  mg / ml ) , and n - hexane extract ( ic50  49.98  1.86  mg / ml ) . the highest quantity of total phenols was obtained in the commercial oil ( 0.96  0.04  mg gallic acid eq./g dry copra ) , the soxhlet extracted oil had 0.78  0.05  mg gallic acid eq./g dry copra , and the lowest was found in the aqueous extract ( 0.08  0.02  mg gallic acid eq./g dry copra ) . \n highest reducing potential was found in commercial oil ( 40.49  1.84  mg bht eq./g dry copra ) , followed by that in soxhlet extracted oil ( 23.11  1.47  mg bht eq./g dry copra ) , aqueous extract ( 4.05  0.29  mg bht eq./g dry copra ) , and n - hexane extract ( 1.51  0.18  mg bht eq./g dry copra ) . \n the anti - inflammatory activity was found to be best for commercial oil ( ic50  0.77  0.06  mg / ml ) followed by soxhlet extracted oil ( ic50  2.17  0.15  mg / ml ) , aqueous extract ( ic50  107.85  3.29 \n mg / ml ) , and n - hexane extract ( ic50  434.52  10.09  mg / ml ) . to the best of our knowledge , we did not find any report on quantification of phytochemicals for aqueous and n - hexane extracts of copra . in agreement with our findings on copra oil \n , previous researchers have also reported on phenolic acids and antioxidant and anti - inflammatory activities in coconut kernel oils [ 18 , 19 ] . \n our observations showed that the commercial copra oil ( experimental control ) showed best antioxidant , total phenol , anti - inflammatory , and reducing power activities , followed by the oil obtained by soxhlet assembly , aqueous extract , and n - hexane extracts of copra . for oil samples , \n this trend is attributed to the differences in the methods of extraction of oil from copra . \n since most phytochemicals are heat sensitive and expeller method of extraction is conducted at relatively lower temperature than soxhlet extraction , higher phytochemical content has been observed in the expeller extracted oil than in soxhlet extracted oil . a high correlation ( r = 0.99 ) between antioxidant activity and reducing power for aqueous and n - hexane extracts , and for commercial and soxhlet extracted oils , was obtained in our study . \n this correlation was in agreement with that reported by rakov et al .   who reported on correlation between antiradical and antioxidant activities of alkaloids isolated from mahonia aquifolium . \n the gc chromatogram of fame of copra oils shows the fatty acid composition of the soxhlet extracted oil and the commercial oil ( figures 1(a ) and 1(b ) , resp . ) . \n table 7 represents the retention times of the fames on the gc column and the % relative composition of the fatty acids . \n fame - gc analyzed the fatty acids of short chain ( c2c6 ) , medium chain ( c8c12 ) , and long chain ( c14c18 ) in coconut oil   against the supelco standard of 37 fames . \n this study showed that the most abundant fatty acid was lauric acid ( c12:0 ) in the oil samples ( 44.84% in commercial oil and 51.88% in soxhlet extracted oil ) . \n therefore , medium chain fatty acids were found to be most predominant in the coconut oil samples which are reported to be health - beneficial . \n they are known to stimulate lactobacilli   and possibly improve cognitive function in type i diabetes patients . the percentage of lauric acid in the soxhlet extracted copra oil was higher than that obtained from coconuts of nigeria ( 41% reported by odenigbo and otisi ) and coconuts of sri lanka ( 49% reported by seneviratne and dissanayake ) . in our study , \n the ratio of saturated fatty acid ( sfa )  :  ( monounsaturated fatty acid ) mufa  :  polyunsaturated fatty acid ( pufa ) in soxhlet extracted oil was found to be 1  :  0.08  :  0.02 and 1  :  0.09  :  0.02 in the commercial oil , signifying these oils to be low in pufa . \n our results on fatty acid composition of copra oils were in agreement with seneviratne and dissanayake   who obtained similar results with coconut oil from coconut kernels cultivated in sri lanka . \n however , these oils do not meet the recommendation of the american heart organization which suggests 1  :  1  :  1 of sfa  :  mufa  :  pufa in edible fats and oils . \n since the copra oil contains mainly saturated fatty acids , the shelf stability of the same will be higher than the unsaturated oils . \n also , owing to the same reason , flavor reversion ( with storage ) will be low as reported by o'brien . \n these findings suggest the oil obtained from copra to be a high stability oil ( due to its oxidative and flavor stability ) . \n these high stability oils are desired in thermal food processing such as in frying and baking , and the copra oil studied would be suitable for these . the copra oil may also find use in triglyceride replication , in blending with other edible oils , and in formulating novel functional oils . \n from our study we conclude that , among the copra extracts and oils , the commercial oil had the highest phytochemical content . a comparatively lower phytochemical \n content in the soxhlet extracted oil indicated mechanical extraction to be more suitable method of oil extraction than solvent extraction . since saturated fats are used in several food applications such as in confectionary and bakery products , we envisage potential applications of the expeller - pressed coconut copra oil in novel product development .", 5037, 389, "arxiv"], [103, "Getting Started\nThese Docs are a Genius App\n\nInteractively explore API endpoints by connecting your Genius account to this page.

viscosity relationship of foods including arrhenius model and williams - landel - ferry ( wlf ) model [ 911 ] . \n the knowledge of glass transition temperature ( tg ) is essential in assuring quality , stability , and safety of various food products . \n most of the honeys were reported to have newtonian fluid like characteristics , whereas , some honey has been reported as non - newtonian fluids . \n some fluids also exhibit a change in viscosity with time at a constant shear rate and classified as thixotropic , where the fluid viscosity decreases with time and rheopectic where the fluid viscosity increases with time . \n radiation processing , a cold process , is used as a method for preservation of food commodities and is finding increasing applications [ 14 , 15 ] . in our earlier study \n complete microbial decontamination of honey was achieved by gamma radiation treatment at 10  kgy for most of the honey samples , however , in a few samples , higher dose of 15  kgy was required . \n the current study deals with evaluation of the rheological and thermal properties of commercial indian honey and analyzing the effect of gamma radiation treatment on these properties . \n the availability of data for such study is very limited worldwide , and in indian context it is not available . \n fresh honey weighing 250  g , packed and sealed in glass bottles , was purchased from a local market and stored at 4c . \n the storage period did not exceed more than 6 months for any of the honey brands . \n the honey samples were kept at ambient temperature ( 26  2c ) overnight before analysis was performed . \n gamma radiation treatment was carried out in a cobalt-60 gamma chamber-5000 ( gc-5000 , source strength co :  260  tbq , brit , mumbai , india , dose rate 6.5  kgy / h ) at bhabha atomic research centre , mumbai , india . \n standard chemical ceric - cerous sulfate dosimeters were used to measure absorbed radiation dose employing electrochemical cell method . \n a 50  ml aliquot of honey was packed and sealed in high - density polyethylene packets and treated with different doses of gamma radiation ( 515  kgy ) at ambient temperature . \n the rheological properties of the honey were evaluated using a physica mcr 301 rheometer from anton paar ( anton paar gmbh , austria , europe ) which has a parallel plate geometry set - up with a fixed lower plate and an upper plate ( referred to as geometry ) that can rotate or oscillate . \n measurements were carried out at eight different temperatures between 5 and 40c and at shear rate ranging from 1.49 to 149  s. as the viscosity of honey can be affected by the presence of air bubbles , therefore , the samples were preconditioned before the rheological analysis . \n the samples were incubated at 50c for 1  h in a water bath and then kept for 15  h at 30c in an incubator . \n then the samples were placed in the measuring element of the rheometer and thermostated to reach the desired temperature of measurement . \n the effect of temperature on the apparent viscosity of honey was analyzed using the arrhenius equation:(1)=a0  e(ea / rt ) , \n where  is the viscosity ( pas ) , a0 is a material constant ( pas ) , ea is the flow activation energy ( j / mol ) , r is the gas constant ( r = 8.31  j / mol  k ) , and t is the absolute temperature ( k ) . the material constant ( preexponential factor in arrhenius equation ) represents viscosity at a temperature approaching infinity . \n the arrhenius parameters were determined through linear regression by plotting the inverse of temperature ( 1/t ) on x - axis and the corresponding observed log viscosity values ( lna ) on y - axis . straight line equation ( y = mx + c ) corresponding to ( 1 ) in logarithmic form , lna = lna0 + ea / r(1/t ) , was obtained , and the a0 and ea values for all the samples were calculated . the mean absolute percentage error ( ma%e ) , which indicates the deviance of the observed values from the calculated viscosity values using the arrhenius equation , \n was calculated using the following formula : \n ( 2)[ma%e=(100n)(y0ycyc ) ] , \n where y0 is the observed value , yc is the calculated value , and n represents the number of pairs of samples [ 10 , 19 ] . \n the glass transition in honey was determined using a differential scanning calorimeter ( mettler toledo ag , 822c , switzerland ) with empty aluminum pan as reference . in principle , differential scanning calorimetry ( dsc ) measures the difference between the heat flows from the sample and reference sides of a sensor as a function of temperature or time . \n differences in heat flow arise when a sample absorbs or releases heat due to thermal effects . \n the calorimeter was attached with a cooling system ( liquid n2 ) which efficiently controlled and monitored temperature up to 150c . \n approximately 3135  mg honey samples were hermetically sealed in aluminium sample pans and analysed by calorimetry under continuous flow of dry n2 gas ( 60  ml / min ) to avoid condensation of moisture . before recording the heating scan the sample was first heated to 50c then cooled to 130c . \n then these samples were scanned between temperature range 130c to 50c at the scanning rate of 10c / min to obtain the complete thermal behavior of honey . \n the presence of the glass transition in the cooling run and the repeated heating cycle indicate the reversibility of the glass transition . \n the star software ( mettler toledo ) was used to obtain the glass transition temperature ( tg ) . \n the experiments were repeated in three independent sets , each in triplicate , and observations were analyzed and expressed in terms of mean and standard deviation ( sd ) by taking all data points in consideration . \n the mean values were compared using one - way anova ( analysis of variance ) at the level of significance , where p  0.05 . \n rheology is used as a quality parameter for many food products and is also an important property for honey . \n the effect of temperature and radiation processing on honey were assessed and the findings are discussed herewith . \n the viscosities of all the seven honey were measured at temperatures ranging from 5c to 40c and found to decrease with increase in the temperature ( figure 1 ) . \n temperature dependent decrease in viscosity of honey may be attributed to reduced molecular friction and hydrodynamic forces . \n all honey followed the same pattern of change in the viscosity with increase in temperature and satisfactorily followed the arrhenius relationship . in all cases the determination coefficient ( r ) exceeded values > 0.99 . \n the mean absolute percentage error varied from 3.7 to 8.4 which is below 10% , that is , the upper limit on the acceptability of ma%e as mentioned by kleijnen . in a recent study on seven varieties of unifloral australian honey , bhandari et al .   found similar observation . \n however , at temperatures above 30c , the differences in viscosity are very small in most of the honey analysed . at higher temperatures \n the difference in viscosity among seven honey brands decreases but still exists even at 40c which could be attributed to the natural variations in composition ( sugar , colloid materials , and water content ) . \n the values of flow activation energy of the analyzed honey ranged from 54.2 to 88.8  kj / mol and the decreasing order of the activation energy for the brands is i > ii > vi>iv > iii > vii > v ( table 1 ) . \n activation energy ( ea ) reflects the sensitivity of viscosity to temperature changes ; higher ea means that the viscosity is relatively more sensitive to a temperature change . \n therefore , the viscosity of the brand i is relatively highly sensitive , whereas , the viscosity of brand vii is least sensitive to the temperature changes . in a recent study on honey produced from different fruit plants of northern india ea \n the ea of greek and polish honeys varied between 69.193.8 kj / mol and 92.3105.3  kj / mol , respectively [ 18 , 25 ] . \n the ea of the turkish honey ranged from 63.4 to 78.5  kj / mol . \n an inverse correlation value of 0.65 was found to exist between ea and moisture content . \n a similar negative correlation value ( r = 0.61 ) was also reported between ea and moisture content for greek honey by lazaridou et al . . \n figure 2(a ) illustrates the viscosity values as a function of shear rate for honey at 25c . \n , the shear stress was always found to be a linear function of shear rate ( figure 2(b ) ) . \n these observations indicated newtonian flow behavior of honey , which has also been reported in case of indian honey by other authors too [ 24 , 27 ] . \n the newtonian behavior has also been shown for the chinese natural honey between the temperature ranges of 1025c . \n none of the analyzed indian honey showed non - newtonian behavior although there are reports of the non - newtonian behavior in some indian honey which may due to the presence of colloidal particles [ 29 , 30 ] . the non - newtonian behavior is not observed in simple liquids of low molecular weight , but is observed in complex fluids like colloids , emulsions , macromolecular solutions , and gels where there are discrete entities at the micro / nanoscale . \n when a physical treatment such as gamma radiation is applied to food some changes on its viscosity may occur but contrary to the belief , in a dose range of 515  kgy , gamma radiation was not found to affect the viscosity of the honey studied ( table 2 ) . \n similar observations were also reported for the viscosity of brazilian honey irradiated up to 10  kgy . \n gamma radiation treatment being a cold physical process does not result in any significant increase in the temperature of the sample being irradiated . \n just after irradiation ( 15  kgy ) of honey , a marginal increase from 28c to 35c was observed , which came down to 28c after 40  min of storage at ambient temperature . the composition of honey is considered to be responsible for its rheological property . \n carbohydrates are the major constituents of honey and about 90% of these are monosaccharides followed by small amount of other disaccharides and trisaccharides . although gamma radiation can cause chain scission and breakage of glycosidic bond resulting in general degradation of the polymers and affect the viscosity , but in case of honey due to the lack of significant level of higher poly- or oligosaccharides and/or other polymeric substances , possibilities of radiation induced depolymerization leading to altered viscosity are very less [ 14 , 15 ] . the glass transition temperature of honey varied from 44.1 to 54.1c , where moisture content varied from 17.221.6  g/100  g ( table 3 ) . \n the thermal behavior of honey is shown in supplementary figure 3 ( supplementary data available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/935129 ) . \n the highest tg ( 44.1c ) was observed for brand ii , whereas , lowest tg was noticed for brand v ( 54.1c ) . \n the tg values obtained in the current study are in good agreement with the literature values . as expected an inverse correlation value of ~0.50 \n the glass transition temperature is a function of both moisture content and the type of solute . \n it is known that the glass transition temperature shifts to lower temperatures with increase in the moisture content as plasticization caused by water results in depression of the tg of completely amorphous and partially crystalline food products due to the ability of water molecules to weaken hydrogen bonds , dipole - dipole , and intra- and intermolecular interactions . \n gamma radiation treatment was not found to affect the glass transition temperature of honey ( table 3 ) , which could be due to the insignificant change in physicochemical composition of honey upon gamma radiation treatment as reported in our earlier study . \n in general , low molecular weight fragments produced by the scission reactions decrease the glass transition temperature of the polymer matrix . \n however , it is felt that due to the lack of significant level of higher poly- or oligosaccharides and/or other polymeric substances in honey , radiation mediated change in tg values is very insignificant . \n to the best of our knowledge this is the first report on the effect of gamma radiation on the glass transition of honey . \n all the commercial indian honey brands evaluated showed newtonian behavior and the viscosity of honey remained unaltered upon gamma radiation treatment . \n the study indicated that arrhenius equation can be suitably used to predict the viscosity values of the honey in the current study . \n interestingly gamma radiation ( 15  kgy ) was also not found to affect the glass transition temperature of honey .", 3217, 258, "arxiv"], [108, "Please help me complete the long-text summarization task, where the long text is 'input' and the summarized result is 'output'.\n\nthe input is: this was a 26 + 26-week , randomized , controlled , open -

related aes , including hypoglycemic episodes , occurred among ideg - treated subjects , although the numbers overall were low . \n slightly more ideg - treated subjects met withdrawal criteria as specified in the protocol or were withdrawn for reasons classified as  other  . of 277 ideg - treated main trial completers , 239 entered the extension into the ideg free - flex arm and 67.8% ( 223 of 329 ) of those randomized in the main trial completed the extension . \n of 152 iglar - treated main trial completers , 133 entered the extension and 74.4% ( 122 of 164 ) of those randomized in the main trial completed the extension . the pattern and \n the percentage of participants withdrawn during the extension were similar with ideg free - flex ( 4.9% ) and iglar ( 6.7% ) . \n baseline characteristics were representative of a t1 dm population with moderate glycemic control ( mean hba1c 7.7% , table 1 ) . \n the pretrial insulin regimen of most participants [ 70.6% ( 348 of 493 ) ] comprised once - daily basal injection with 3 or more bolus doses daily . \n iglar and iasp were used by 63.7% ( 314 of 493 ) and 50.9% ( 251 of 493 ) of participants , respectively , before entering the trial . \n the following proportions of subjects took basal insulin od and more than od , respectively , at screening : ideg forced - flex , 68.3% ( 112 of 164 ) and 31.7% ( 52 of 164 ) , ideg , 70.9% ( 117 of 165 ) and 29.1% ( 48 of 165 ) , and iglar , 72.6% ( 119 of 164 ) and 27.4% ( 45 of 164 ) . demographics and baseline characteristics : full analysis set abbreviations : bid , twice daily ; tid , 3 times daily . \n subjects randomized to the ideg forced - flex and ideg treatment arms during the main trial period had the opportunity to continue in the ideg free - flex arm after 26 weeks of treatment . \n one subject was randomized to iglar , although her antidiabetic treatment regimen at screening was basal od plus premix insulin tid . \n one subject was randomized to ideg forced - flex , although his antidiabetic treatment regimen at screening was bid premix insulin ; he was not withdrawn because this deviation was discovered late in the trial . \n consistent with the treat - to - target methodology , the observed mean decrease in hba1c from baseline to week 26 was similar among ideg forced - flex ( 0.40% points ) , ideg ( 0.41% points ) , and iglar ( 0.58% points ; figure 1a ) groups . \n the primary objective of the trial was met because ideg forced - flex was shown to be noninferior to iglar in reducing hba1c [ estimated treatment difference ( etd ) ( idegforced - flex - iglar ) : 0.17% points ( 0.04 ; 0.30)95%ci ] . \n the robustness of the primary analysis was further supported by pp and additional sensitivity analyses ( supplemental table 2 ) . \n there was no difference in observed mean decrease in hba1c from baseline to week 26 between ideg forced - flex ( 0.40% points ) and ideg ( 0.41% points ) ; etd [ idegforced - flex - ideg ] : 0.01% points [ 0.13 ; 0.14]95%ci . \n glycemic efficacy : mean hba1c  sem over time ( a ) and mean fpg  sem over time ( b ) \n last observation carried forward is used for each postbaseline time point in a and b. subjects randomized to the ideg forced - flex and ideg treatment arms during the main trial period had the opportunity to continue in the ideg free - flex arm after 26 weeks of treatment . \n laboratory - measured fpg decreased from baseline to week 26 ( ideg forced - flex , 1.28 ; ideg , 2.54 ; iglar , 1.33 \n mmol / l ) , with the most pronounced decline occurring during the first 12 weeks ( figure 1b ) . \n no significant difference was seen with ideg forced - flex vs iglar ( supplemental table 2 ) , but a greater reduction was seen with ideg than with ideg forced - flex [ etd ( idegforced - flex - ideg ) : 0.95 mmol / l ( 0.15 ; 1.75)95%ci , p = .021 ] . \n after 26 weeks , observed 9-point smpg means appeared similar among groups . despite varying dosing times with ideg forced - flex , the only difference in smpg vs iglar was before lunch [ etd ( idegforced - flex - iglar ) : 0.85 mmol / l ( 0.12 ; 1.57)95%ci , p = .022 ] . \n the proportion of participants who attained prebreakfast smpg target less than 5.0 mmol / l at week 26 was 11.3% ( ideg forced - flex ) , 23.8% ( ideg ) , and 18.4% ( iglar ) . \n the median time to achieving the prebreakfast titration target for the first time was 7 weeks ( ideg forced - flex ) , 4 weeks ( ideg ) , and 6 weeks ( iglar ) . \n although mean hba1c values increased slightly from 26-week levels during the extension , they remained below baseline at week 52 ; 0.13% points from baseline to 7.6% ( ideg free - flex ) and 0.21% points from baseline to 7.5% ( iglar ) . \n ideg free - flex was not significantly different from iglar in lowering hba1c in the fas or ets at week 52 , with an upper 95% ci limit below a predefined noninferiority mark of 0.4% ( supplemental table 2 ) . \n mean fpg decreased from baseline to week 52 with ideg free - flex ( 1.73 mmol / l ) and iglar ( 0.61 \n mmol / l ) , with significantly greater reduction observed with ideg free- flex [ etd ( idegfree - flex - iglar ) : 1.07 mmol / l ( 1.82 ; 0.32)95%ci , p = .005 ] . \n mean 9-point smpg profiles decreased from baseline to week 52 in both groups . at week 52 , smpg profiles were similar at all time points except at 90 minutes after the main evening meal , when it was significantly lower with ideg free - flex [ etd ( idegfree - flex - iglar ) : 0.82 mmol / l ( 1.53 ; 0.12)95%ci , p = .022 ] . \n the proportion of participants who attained prebreakfast smpg < 5.0 mmol / l at week 52 was 17.9% ( ideg free - flex ) and 13.8% ( iglar ) . \n mean basal doses increased slightly during weeks 026 with ideg forced - flex and iglar . however , basal doses remained stable with ideg during weeks 026 and in the ideg free - flex and iglar groups from week 27 to week 52 . \n mean daily iasp doses increased slightly during the main period in the iglar group . at week 52 , mean daily basal , bolus , and total insulin doses were lower by 4% , 18% , and 11% , respectively , with ideg free - flex vs iglar . \n the greater mean total daily insulin dose with iglar vs ideg free - flex was due mainly to a decrease in mean daily bolus insulin dose with ideg free - flex ( 0.39 to 0.35 u / kg ) and an increase with iglar ( 0.40 to 0.42 u / kg ; table 2 ) . \n mean daily insulin dose ( sd ) : safety analysis set abbreviation : n / a , not applicable . \n subjects randomized to the ideg forced - flex and ideg treatment arms during the main trial period had the opportunity to continue in the ideg free - flex arm after 26 weeks of treatment . \n the data for ideg forced - flex and ideg arms from the first 26 weeks were pooled into the ideg free - flex arm in this table . \n mean ratio is the unadjusted ratio between mean doses at last treatment visit , in which missing data are imputed using last observation carried forward . \n overall , confirmed and severe hypoglycemia rates were similar across groups at week 26 ( figure 2 and supplemental table 3 ) . \n the nocturnal confirmed hypoglycemia rate was significantly lower with ideg forced - flex than iglar [ by 40% ; err ( idegforced - flex / iglar ) : 0.60 ( 0.44 ; 0.82)95%ci , p = .001 ] and ideg [ by 37% ; err ( idegforced - flex / ideg ) : 0.63 ( 0.46 ; 0.86)95%ci , p = .003 ] . \n nocturnal confirmed hypoglycemia rates were generally lower with ideg forced - flex than with iglar and ideg , regardless of the day of the week ( supplemental table 4 ) . \n no significant difference in overall confirmed hypoglycemia was seen at week 52 between ideg free - flex and iglar in the fas or ets . although the number of events was small , the severe hypoglycemia rate was numerically lower in the fas and significantly lower by 53% [ err ( idegfree - flex / iglar ) : 0.47 ( 0.23 ; 0.94)95%ci , p = .033 ] in the ets with ideg free - flex . \n nocturnal confirmed hypoglycemia rates were significantly lower with ideg free - flex by 25% [ err ( idegfree - flex / iglar ) : 0.75 ( 0.58 ; 0.97)95%ci , p = .026 ] in the fas and by 27% [ err ( idegfree - flex/ iglar ) : 0.73 ( 0.54 ; 0.98)95%ci , p = .035 ] in the ets . \n hypoglycemia over time , weeks 052 : severe hypoglycemia ( a ) ; overall confirmed hypoglycemia ( b ) ; and nocturnal confirmed hypoglycemia ( c ) . \n percentage risk reductions refer to delta risks based on estimated rate ratios ( fas ) . \n subjects randomized to the ideg forced - flex and ideg treatment arms during the main trial period had the opportunity to continue in the ideg free - flex arm after 26 weeks of treatment . \n rates for aes were 443 ( ideg forced - flex ) , 550 ( ideg ) , and 527 ( iglar ) per 100 patient - years of exposure ( pye ) from week 0 to week 26 and 447 ( ideg free - flex ) and 481 ( iglar ) per 100 pye from week 0 to week 52 . \n most aes were mild or moderate and considered unrelated to basal insulin , with no treatment - specific patterns observed ( supplemental tables 5 and 6 ) . \n injection - site reaction rates were low over 52 weeks , with 6 ( ideg free - flex ) and 4 ( iglar ) events per 100 pye ; no reactions were classified as serious . \n mean weight gain from baseline to week 26 and during the extension was modest , with no between - group differences at week 52 ( ideg free - flex , 1.3 kg ; iglar , 1.9 kg ; supplemental table 2 ) . \n serious aes ( saes ) were reported by 5.5% ( ideg forced - flex ) , 4.2% ( ideg ) , and 5.0% ( iglar ) of participants from week 0 to week 26 and by 7.6% ( ideg free - flex ) and 7.5% ( iglar ) of participants in total from week 0 to week 52 ( supplemental table 5 ) . \n of randomized subjects who did not enter the extension , 10.0% ( 5 of 50 ) ideg forced - flex , 2.5% ( 1 of 40 ) ideg , and 6.5% ( 2 of 31 ) iglar - treated subjects reported saes during the main period . of randomized subjects who entered the extension , 3.5% ( 4 of 114 ) ideg forced - flex , 4.8% ( 6 of 125 ) ideg , and 4.5% ( 6 of 133 ) iglar - treated subjects reported saes during the main period . \n saes were distributed similarly among groups ; few were considered related to the trial product and the most frequently reported saes were related to hypoglycemia ( supplemental table 7 ) . \n one death , suicide by assumed - intentional insulin overdose , occurred in an ideg - treated female participant 158 days after starting the trial drug . \n concentrations of ideg - specific antibodies and antibodies cross - reacting between ideg and human insulin were low during the main and extension periods ( supplemental table 8) , with no apparent association between the development of antibodies and hba1c or insulin dose ( data not shown ) . \n no clinically relevant treatment - related differences were noted in physical examination findings , vital signs , electrocardiograms , funduscopy , or laboratory measurements . \n intensive insulin therapy in clinical trials is associated with lower rates of diabetes complications versus nonintensive therapy in people with t1 dm and is presently considered the standard of care ( 13 ) . \n basal - bolus regimens with insulins designed to closely mimic a physiologic profile allow many patients to reach glycemic targets . however , issues related to variability of action ( leading to unexpected hypoglycemia ) , and the need to adapt one 's lifestyle to the action profile of a prescribed insulin , can prevent the achievement of good glycemic control in a safe manner . \n ideg 's duration of action exceeds 42 hours , providing full 24-hour basal insulin coverage and offering a consistent glucose - lowering effect , thus potentially allowing administration within a broader dosing window ( 7 , 8) . in the present study , \n the aim was to evaluate whether ideg dosed in a flexible regimen would be safe and effective in patients with t1 dm . \n the prebreakfast titration target 4.05.0 mmol / l was narrower than targets described in some other intensive t1 dm basal - bolus trials ( 17 ) ; however , given that the pharmacokinetic profile of ideg shows potential to lower hypoglycemic risk compared with current therapies ( 8 , 18 ) and other recent trials in patients with t2 dm and t1 dm have investigated comparably low titration targets ( 1923 ) , an ambitious target was considered appropriate and the ultimate decision regarding insulin dose was the investigator 's . \n this was a novel trial both for investigators and participants because it challenged deeply ingrained habits by asking people with long - standing t1 dm to inject basal insulin at varying daily time points while simultaneously aiming for the ambitious fpg targets considered attainable given ideg 's pharmacokinetic profile . over 26 weeks , the forced - flex regimen proved effective ( noninferior ) compared with iglar and ideg and , even more importantly , proved safe . \n flexibly dosed ideg demonstrated lower rates of nocturnal hypoglycemia than iglar , reaffirming findings of previous phase 2 and 3 trials ( 9 , 24 ) . \n however , this trial was unique in that it captured daily 4-point smpg , which may partially explain higher overall hypoglycemia rates observed in this study vs a previous trial that compared od ideg and iglar in patients with t1 dm ( 9 ) . \n analysis between ideg and iglar od at 26 weeks was not a prespecified end point within this trial , and thus , no statistical analysis was performed , although observed efficacy and safety data are presented for each of the 3 treatment arms through week 26 . \n this comparison has been evaluated in other studies in patients with t1 dm ( 9 ) and t2 dm ( 25 ) . \n full - year results confirmed findings from the 26-week main trial , with the extension allowing all ideg subjects the option to dose more flexibly than at same time daily . \n this is important because such an option would positively impact patients ' abilities to lead the type of modern , hectic lives typical of people with t1 dm , including travel , dining out , changing bedtimes , etc , without compromising glucose control or safety \n . limitations of this study include a smaller population size compared with previous ideg studies ; the relatively short time frame of the forced - flex regimen ; and different recommendations for transferring subjects on more - than - od basal insulin to ideg and iglar at the study 's start ( total basal dose was transferred 1:1 for ideg , as is standard for switching long acting insulins , but reduced 20%30% for iglar ) . \n more ideg- than iglar - treated participants withdrew from the trial during the main period ; the rates of withdrawal could be related to the demanding nature of the study ( particularly in the forced - flex arm ) , including frequent blood glucose measurement requirements and study visits . \n however , reasons for withdrawal among the 3 treatment arms were sufficiently varied that no clear explanation for the higher rate in the ideg arms could be identified . \n data were not collected on dosing times during the extension ; therefore , it is unknown how many ideg free - flex participants varied dosing times . \n this was an open - label trial , and investigators may have been more alert in their management and documentation of the ideg forced - flex arm than the ideg or iglar arms ; caution on the part of investigators and subjects may partially explain some differences ( such as in fpg and nocturnal confirmed hypoglycemia ) in study results between ideg forced - flex and ideg . additionally , the 2 insulins tested used different delivery devices and unavailability of placebo - filled devices precluded double - dummy masking ( although such a design may be considered unethical in patients with t1 dm due to the 8 or more daily injections required ) . \n the authors do not advocate stretching insulin - dose timing to these limits in clinical practice , but this study has important implications for patients with t1 dm and may herald a departure from restrictive dosing regimens . \n this trial demonstrates that ideg 's ultralong duration of action allows variation of daily administration times without compromising efficacy or safety in patients with t1 dm who require multiple daily injections . \n it offers patients and clinicians insight into using this new basal insulin to assist patients in reaching glycemic targets despite ever - changing daily lifestyles . \n ", 8157, 519, "arxiv"], [109, "John decides to install a ramp in his house.

old son , ben , who has terminal brain cancer , plays in the background . \n the story has a classic dramatic arc in which the father is struggling to connect to and enjoy his son , all the while knowing that the child has only a few months to live . \n the clip concludes with the father finding the strength to stay emotionally close to his son  until he takes his last breath . \n we also developed a video of the same father and son spending a day at the zoo . \n this version does not mention cancer or death , but the boy is bald ( from his chemotherapy ) and is called  miracle boy  once during the clip . \n this video lacks the tension induced by the typical story form but includes the same characters . \n this version was used as a control story to see what the brain does when any video is being watched . in our first study of narratives , we took blood before and after participants watched one of the two versions of the video.11 we found that the narrative with the dramatic arc caused an increase in cortisol and oxytocin . \n tellingly , the change in oxytocin had a positive correlation with participants feeling of empathy for ben and his father . heightened empathy motivated participants to offer money to a stranger who was in the experiment . \n flat  narrative of ben and his father at the zoo did not increase oxytocin or cortisol , and participants did not report empathy for the story s characters . \n these findings suggest that emotionally engaging narratives inspire post - narrative actions  in this case , sending money to a stranger . \n , we did not know for sure that oxytocin was the reason participants cared about the people in the video , just that oxytocin and empathy were correlated . \n our previous study pointed to oxytocin as the biological instrument that puts people in thrall to a story . to assess the causal impact of oxytocin on narrative immersion , we ran a study using public service announcements ( psas ) in which participants received intranasal infusions of synthetic oxytocin or a placebo . this time around , we decided to test a larger set of video narratives . \n we wanted stories that most people would not have seen before and ones that could elicit a prosocial action at a cost ( such as a donation ) . \n we found a rich trove of public service announcements from the united kingdom that are well - produced and engaging . \n the experiment used sixteen psas that ran for thirty or sixty seconds on four topics : smoking , drinking to excess , speeding , and global warming . to incentivize people to pay attention to the videos , each of the participants was paid five dollars if they could correctly answer a factual question about the ad immediately after watching it . \n for example ,  was there a car in the video ?  then , our software asked participants if they would like to donate some of the five dollars they had just earned to a charity associated with the cause shown in the psa . \n none of the psas solicited donations , they simply told stories about social issues . computer software presented all the videos and post - video questions and we used random participant identifiers so that one s donation behavior was kept private . \n forty people received either 40 iu of oxytocin or an equivalent amount of normal saline ( placebo ) . \n participants started watching the videos after an hour - long period during which the synthetic oxytocin diffuses from the sinuses into the brain . \n we found that those who received oxytocin donated , on average , 56 percent more money to charity compared with participants who received the placebo.12 this confirmed the causal role of oxytocin on post - narrative prosocial behavior . \n we discovered that participants who were given oxytocin showed substantially more concern for the characters in the psas . \n this increased concern motivated them to want to help by donating money to a charity that could alleviate the suffering these stories depicted . \n it is as if the brain is lazy and is using a  monkey see , monkey do  approach to assess appropriate social behaviors . \n ( indeed , the brain seeks to conserve energy by using default pathways  a kind of  laziness .  ) \n the psas seemed to persuade viewers that ( for example ) nowadays the humans are very concerned about drinking too much , so as a human , i , too , should be concerned . \n such responses are what social creatures with social brains do . and yet , participants understand that the stories are fictional and are portrayed by professional actors . \n the money donated to charity can not help these actors out of their fictional binds . \n the money might help prevent the harm depicted in the psas from happening to an unknown other person , but this is a big  if . \n nevertheless , oxytocin makes people want to help others in costly and tangible ways . in another experiment,12 we sought to replicate our earlier study by taking blood samples before a group of forty - two participants ( who were not in the oxytocin infusion study ) watched one of the uk psas . \n we measured the change in oxytocin and in a fast - acting arousal hormone with a long name that is abbreviated acth . \n when the psa elicited an increase in both acth and oxytocin , donations were 261 percent higher than when one or both of these biomarkers did not rise . \n the change in acth correlated with the amount of attention people paid to the story . \n this finding makes sense : if we do not attend to a story , it will not pull us into its narrative arc . \n attention is a scarce neural resource because it is metabolically costly to a brain that needs to conserve resources . \n if a story does not sustain our attention , then the brain will look for something else more interesting to do . \n we also found that the change in oxytocin was associated with concern for the characters in the story , replicating our earlier finding . \n if you pay attention to the story and become emotionally engaged with the story s characters , then it is as if you have been transported into the story s world . \n this is why your palms sweat when james bond dodges bullets . and why you stifle a sniffle when bambi s mother dies . \n narratives that cause us to pay attention and also involve us emotionally are the stories that move us to action . \n more generally , stories with a dramatic arc fit the requirements for high - impact narratives . \n this structure sustains attention by building suspense while at the same time providing a vehicle for character development . \n the climax of the story keeps us on the edge of our neural seats until the tension is relieved at the finish . \n theorists including aristotle ( poetics , 335 bce ) , gustav freytag ( die technik des dramas , 1863 ) , and joseph campbell ( the hero with a thousand faces , 1949 ) have contended that the rising and falling tension of dramatic performances facilitate the audience s emotional connection to the characters . \n now let s get down to brass tacks : why are there so many dreadful movies ? \n humans have known about the three - act structure and mythos , pathos , and ethos for 2,500 years . \n department of defense wanted to know why narratives are persuasive and supported our research and that of other labs as well . \n attention is easy to measure rapidly , via a quickened heartbeat or sweat coming from eccrine glands in the skin . \n nature provided a solution . while we were mostly interested in oxytocin in the brain , the stimulus - induced co - release of oxytocin in the brain and blood meant we could measure changing activity in regions with densities of oxytocin receptors . the vagus nerve ( the longest cranial nerve , which innervates the heart and gut ) is chock - full of oxytocin receptors . with a bit of algorithmic \n fiddling , scientists can measure the activity of the vagus using an electrocardiogram ( ecg ) . \n we confirmed that the change in oxytocin in blood correlates with changes in vagus nerve activity . \n we returned to the story of the dying child ben because it is a reliable way to stimulate oxytocin release . \n this time we measured cardiac activity using an ecg and sweat using an electrodermal sensor on the fingers . because we were developing a system that might be used in a war zone , we built in redundancies . \n attention was measured using both heart rate and skin conductance changes from sweat on the fingers ; emotional resonance was quantified using two measures of changes in the brain s relaxation response driven by the vagus nerve . \n the exciting part was that we could measure both effects up to one thousand times a second with off - the - shelf wireless technologies . \n but it is not so simple to isolate the effects of a story from everything else the brain is doing to keep you upright , breathing , and conscious . \n all neuroscience studies need to extract the neurologic signal produced by a stimulus during an experiment from the background noise of all other neural activity . \n to give you a sense of the scope of this problem , for every thirty people we test for an hour each , we collect a terabyte of peripheral neurologic data . \n most of this data is not relevant to understanding why people respond to stories , but the faint traces that are relevant must be extracted and processed with extraordinary care . \n once we did all this , the data told us several interesting things.13 first among them is that the brain does not work like the hypothetical story structure known as freytag s pyramid , in which strictly rising action leads to a climax , and then strictly falling action occurs as the story resolves . \n even for the one - hundred - second  ben  video , one s attention waxes and wanes . \n the brain is attending to the story and then doing a quick search of the rest of the environment , and then refocusing on the story as the tension rises . \n nevertheless , the peak attentional response occurs in the climax , when ben s father reveals that ben is dying . that s a bombshell to which people pay attention . \n after about thirty seconds , vagal activity begins to increase as viewers get to know and then begin to empathize with ben and his father . \n not only were we able we track what the brain is doing millisecond by millisecond during a story , we used the neurologic data to build a predictive model of donations to a childhood cancer charity  our measure of story impact . \n the statistical model we built predicts whether a participant would donate money with 82 percent accuracy . \n that is , by measuring how your peripheral nervous system responds to a story , we can almost perfectly predict what you ll do before you do it . \n the participants who , for whatever reason , either lost interest in the video or did nt form an emotional connection to ben and his father almost never donated money to charity . \n the money will not save ben and it wo nt offer relief to his father . \n it seems that once we are attentive and emotionally engaged , our brains go into mimic mode and mirror the behaviors that the characters in the story are doing , or might do . as social creatures we are biased toward engaging with others , and effective stories \n truth be told , ben s story is as near to a perfect high - impact narrative as there is . \n we wondered if neurologic data could identify bad stories , too . and what about stories that may be distasteful but that are still desirable to watch ? \n i m glad i did , but i do nt have much desire to watch it again . \n our next study tested stories about  hot - button  issues to see how people reacted to potentially disagreeable topics . \n we used first - person narratives from storycorps , a nonprofit that collects and distributes personal stories . \n we choose six stories on racism , gun control , and the terrorist attacks of september 11 . \n for our  narrative impact  measure , we invited participants to donate some of their earnings to a charity associated with the topic of the story . \n just as in the  ben  story , we confirmed that stories that sustain attention and generate emotional resonance produce post - narrative donations  even stories on difficult topics . to the brain , \n good stories are good stories , whether first - person or third - person , on topics happy or sad , as long as they get us to care about their characters . \n psycholinguists have shown that effective stories induce  transportation  into the narrative.14 transportation happens when one loses oneself in the flow of the story  just like i did while watching million dollar baby . to understand the psychological effects of stories \n , we included surveys of narrative transportation and concern for story characters in the storycorps study . \n this shows why stories affect behavior after the story has ended : we have put ourselves into the narrative . \n even a week after the experiment , accurate story recall was predicted by a single measure : narrative transportation . \n you may be thinking that we have a money - centric approach to assessing when people are moved by a story . \n let s try a different approach : we ll have thousands of people rate stories instead . \n the stories we used were tv commercials . conveniently , this is just what usa today asks readers to do on super bowl sunday : vote for the commercials they like the best . \n about five thousand people voted for their favorite commercials in 2014 , and the style and content of these short narratives vary from the unusual to poignant to just plain silly . \n this gave us a chance to further refine our algorithms and test them against what people say they like . \n usa today does not simply provide a ranking of commercials ; it has its readers rate them on a one to ten scale . \n my group derived a quantification of narrative engagement using neurologic data so we , too , could rate story quality . \n we estimated the relative contribution of attention and emotional resonance on story impact from our corpus of studied stories . \n we call this measure a story s zest ( for zak engagement statistic ) . by estimating each super bowl ad s zest \n , we could compare the usa today readers ad likability with the zest measure of brain activity . \n three days after the 2014 super bowl , sixteen participants watched the top ten super bowl commercials in random order in my lab while we measured their peripheral neurologic activity . \n there was no correlation at all between what usa today readers said they liked and a commercial s zest . \n so we ran another study using usa today s top ten 2013 super bowl commercials and found exactly the same thing : zero correlation . \n these findings suggest that people are unable to articulate what they like and do not like . \n perhaps this should not surprise us . in a classic study , psychologist and economics nobel laureate daniel kahneman found that people s preferences for things they have not experienced are largely unformed.15 watching the super bowl commercials myself , i sensed why it is hard to articulate what one likes . the best super bowl commercial in 2014 , according to usa today readers , \n produced for budweiser beer . in the first ten seconds , one sees a puppy nuzzling the nose of a clydesdale horse . \n one immediately recognizes the clydesdale as the budweiser icon , and this tells viewers what they can expect from the ad . \n the suspense is gone , and our neurologic measures show that people s attention wanders starting fifteen seconds into the commercial . without attention , \n the hoped - for emotional resonance with the ad s characters ( and presumably the brand ) fails to occur . but ask people what they like and , gosh , they see puppies and horses and wide open country and , well , of course we love these images . \n the commercial is dull . in all our studies we ruled out effects that might influence zest , including movement , cars , buildings , attractive men and women , and many other factors . \n department of defense s funding of the emerging science of narrative jump - started the field.16 \n 17 storytellers have always known that attention and emotion are important to develop during a narrative , but now we have ways to measure these responses directly rather than rely on incohate impressions such as  entertaining  or  fascinating .  yet , even with millennia of practice , creating a great story is difficult . the emerging science of narrative can guide the art , but it can not replace it . \n the narrator in million dollar baby describes the heroine , maggie s , desire to be a boxer as  ... the magic of risking everything for a dream that nobody sees but you .", 3816, 71, "arxiv"], [114, "Identify and describe three important features of a project planning tool.", 13, 117, "alpaca"], [115, "Please help me complete the long-text summarization task, where the long text is 'input' and the summarized result is 'output'.\n\nthe input is: ludwig , adachi , and matzuzawa ( 2011 ) recently published the results of an experiment in which chimpanzees and normal human participants had been trained to make speeded manual discrimination responses using a touch screen . on each trial , \n a small central white or black square was briefly - presented on a computer monitor . \n next , two larger squares ( one black , the other white ) appeared on the upper part of the screen . \n the participants simply had to touch the square of the matching colour as rapidly and accurately as possible . \n after sufficient training ( always a concern with animal studies ) , the chimps were able to respond as rapidly as their human counterparts . \n however , on every trial , when the two squares were presented on the screen , a high or low tone was presented in the background ( see http://www.pnas.org/content/suppl/2011/11/30/1112605108.dcsupplemental for a video ) . \n both groups of participants responded significantly more rapidly to the white ( black ) square when the high ( low ) tone was presented than when the mapping was reversed . \n crossmodal matches between distinct sensory dimensions , like here between auditory pitch and visual brightness , have been variously documented in human adults and infants over the years , and can be encompassed under the label of crossmodal correspondences ( see spence , 2011 , for a review ) . at the very least , ludwig et al . \n 's ( 2011 ) results provide one of the first examples that animals exhibit crossmodal correspondences much like the rest of us . \n clever dogs tested by researchers in vienna . for while the latter canines could apparently match the sight and sound of a dog of the appropriate size , their gaze to a large or small dog image ( tested in a preferential looking paradigm ) was n't influenced by the presentation of a high or low pitched tone ( farag et al . , 2010 ) . \n the latter result was taken to suggest that man 's best friend is simply not smart enough to make such symbolic , or abstract , cross - sensory matches . \n the fact that chimps do is important for a number of reasons : first , because such results challenge linguistic accounts of crossmodal correspondences ( see martino & marks ' , 1999 , semantic coding hypothesis or the idea that these might be \n . 's ( 2011 ) results are all the more important in that they provide perhaps the first compelling demonstration that animals can match features between modalities in a way that is not simply explainable by their picking - up on an amodal stimulus property , such as shape ( as demonstrated by research on the crossmodal transfer of shape information between vision and touch ; e.g. , ettlinger & wilson , 1990 ; meltzoff & borton , 1979 ; parker & easton , 2004 ) , nor are they reducible to the pick - up of some sort of sensory equivalence between , for example , auditory and visual stimulus intensity ( see lewkowicz & lickliter , 1981 ) . that said , ludwig et al . ( \n 2011 ) are certainly not the first to have looked for such apparently arbitrary crossmodal correspondences in animals : ettlinger ( 1961 ) tried , and failed , to show metaphorical crossmodal matches in monkeys . and while premack and premack ( 2003 , pp 216218 ) make the dramatic claim that monkeys systematically match round to soft and pink , and angular to rough and red in their book on the origins of intelligence , we have been unable to find any independent empirical support for this claim . \n ludwig et al . ( 2011 ) argue that there was unlikely to have been any correlation between the dimensions of pitch and brightness in the chimp 's sensory environment . as such \n , they could not have learned this crossmodal association or correspondence : hence the authors came to the dramatic conclusion that such crossmodal matching must be innate . \n similar claims for innateness have also been made for certain other crossmodal correspondences ( shepherd , 2012 ) . \n other researchers who are unable to find any obvious environmental source for a particular correspondence between particular sensory features ( or dimensions ) often use the term \n synaesthetic instead ( here meaning that the correspondence involves a surprising or unexpected pairing of sensory dimensions , e.g. , see walker et al . , 2010 ) rather than calling the phenomenon that they have \n discovered a crossmodal correspondence ( spence , 2011 ) or a natural crossmodal mapping ( evans & treisman , 2010 ) . \n this places one on a slippery slope that leads from the finding that chimpanzees ' behaviour is influenced by a  synaesthestic mapping between the senses to the much broader claim that chimpanzees are synaesthetes . for many researchers , \n the latter term primarily refers to rare cases where certain sensory or conceptual inducers elicit idiosyncratic yet consistent , involuntary conscious sensory concurrents ( see deroy & spence , forthcoming ) . \n the lack of evidence regarding the occurrence of a conscious synaesthetic concurrent should be sufficient to question the appropriateness of applying the term to chimpanzees . \n furthermore , lewkowicz ( 2011 ) recently articulated the concern held by many researchers that there simply is n't enough genetic material to code all those abilities / behaviours that researchers seemingly want to suggest are innate , including probably crossmodal correspondences . \n it is even doubtful whether we need to posit an innate basis for these correspondences is doubtful given the evidence that at least adults are able to learn novel associations between initially uncorrelated sensory dimensions very rapidly ( ernst , 2007 ) . \n now where might the crossmodal correspondence between pitch and lightness have been learned ? in most natural environments , \n humans and presumably many other species ( e.g. , chimps ) have been shown to internalize such information in terms of a  light - from - above  prior ( adams , graf , & ernst , 2004 ) . \n add to this the fact that smaller bodies or objects will , generally - speaking , make higher - pitched sounds when struck , sounded , voiced etc . \n than larger objects , and further that smaller objects are more likely to be found in the sky than large objects ( elephants and whales were presumably never going to fly ) . \n the suggestion that emerges is that there may indeed be an environmental association between lightness , pitch and size : smaller higher - pitched objects are , statistically - speaking more likely to be located somewhat closer to the source of ambient illumination and hence to be better illuminated and appear visually lighter than larger objects . of course \n , many such suggestions regarding the environmental origins of such  surprising crossmodal correspondences ( see also walker et al . , 2010 ) have something of the unsatisfactory feel of the  just - so  stories popularized by evolutionary psychologists . \n they are certainly hard to prove without some kind of environmental sampling of the statistics of the natural environment ( see geisler , 2008 , for a review ) . \n one other possibility to consider here is that given that crossmodal correspondences are transitive , once the two former statistical regularities are learned ( lightness  size ; size  pitch ) , the mind / brain will also acquire the correspondence between lightness and pitch . \n the two hypotheses ( direct or indirect acquisition ) might generate different models and predictions . what they both confirm \n , however , is that looking carefully for the environmental source of such surprising correspondences , once demonstrated , may be preferable to many than the alternative claim that such phenomena are innate , or for that matter , that chimps are synaesthetic .", 1680, 150, "arxiv"], [116, "Using the given data structure, find and return the 3 highest distinct numbers in descending order.

stage systems invariably results in a microgap ( 1050  m ) , which communicates with the much larger residual cavity created between the abutment screw and the internal implant wall . \n previous evidence has shown that gram - positive , and gram - negative bacteria found in the oral cavity can colonize the inner surfaces of implants and the microgap area [ 35 ] ; and cause inflammatory reactions in the peri - implant soft tissues . \n furthermore , in a fascinating study zipprich et al .   have shown that cyclical loading of the implant / abutment interface can result in the pumping of the liquid contained in implant cavities into the peri - implant compartment . \n the existence of an inflammatory cell infiltrate at the level of the implant - abutment junction  even around implants placed in areas of meticulous plaque control and clinically healthy , soft tissues  has been described in a series of animal studies [ 710 ] . \n however , other pre - clinical studies have reported a significant reduction in both inflammatory cell infiltrate and bone loss in both one - piece implants ( compared to conventional two - piece implants ) and designs in which the abutment / implant interface has been changed [ 9 , 11 ] . \n thus , it has been suggested that the microgap in two - piece implants plays a key role in the generation of an inflammatory cell infiltrate , and crestal bone loss ,   through effects on hard and soft peri - implant tissues . \n demonstrated that in dogs , the major cell type constituting the inflammatory infiltrate around the microgap of submerged and nonsubmerged two - piece implants was the neutrophil . in their experiment , while there was no selective neutrophil accumulation and a significant reduction of mononuclear cells adjacent to one - piece implants , the population of mononuclear cells was significantly increased around two - piece implants . \n another study , in monkeys , showed an inflammatory cell infiltrate containing mostly lymphocytes and plasma cells in two - piece implants . \n the pathophysiological consequences of the implant - abutment interface position have clinically important implications , since esthetic demands encourage the placement of implants in a more apical position . \n such placement could promote inflammation and bone loss , gingival recession , and esthetic failure . \n relative to the original alveolar crest position , implants placed on the crestal or subcrestal level have demonstrated greater bone loss than implants placed supracrestally [ 13 , 14 , 16 ] . \n additionally , experiments with subcrestal implant interfaces showed a significantly greater density of neutrophils than did supracrestal interfaces , but the size of the microgap was not a contributing factor in crestal bone resorption [ 12 , 17 ] . \n a prospective clinical trial has identified a similar relationship between the location of the interface and the magnitude of bone loss , which ratifies the findings described above . in this clinical investigation , \n when the implant interface was positioned close to the original alveolar crest , greater bone loss occurred in comparison to implant interfaces placed more supracrestally . \n thus , the location of the interface is an important determinant of alveolar bone loss in humans , as has been described in initial observations   and previous animal studies [ 20 , 21 ] . \n it is widely known that bone matrix is resorbed by osteoclasts , which are multinucleated giant cells that originate from hematopoietic progenitors of the monocyte / macrophage lineage . \n it has been reported that lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) can induce bone resorption [ 23 , 24 ] and osteoclast formation . \n lps supported the survival of preosteoclasts ( mononuclear osteoclasts ) through nf-b activation independent of host factors such as pge2 , rankl , il-1 , and tnf- . \n osteoclast formation can be modulated by il-1 and tnf- while enhancing the expression of rankl . \n lps derived from different sources has been employed to specify an effector mechanism relevant to dental implants . \n thus , while tesmer et al . have shown that certain dental implant designs contribute to the development of multiple colony forming units for both a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis , koutouzis et al . \n employed e. coli bacterial culture solution to demonstrate that implant design affects invasion of oral microorganisms into the fixture  abutment interface microgap under dynamic - loading conditions . \n thus , it has been shown that inflammatory cells , microbial cells and/or fluid [ 810 , 14 , 30 ] are associated with the implant - abutment interface . \n [ 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 ] nevertheless , the putative correlation between the microgap presence and crestal bone loss has remained refractory to mechanistic explanation . \n consequently , the purpose of the present study was to investigate the possible mechanisms of crestal bone loss around dental implants using a bacterial endotoxin model in vitro . \n we hypothesized that bacterial products originating from the microgap cause the upregulation of cytokines , in healthy peri - implant macrophages , mesenchymal stromal cells and gingival fibroblasts that result in the recruitment of resorptively active osteoclasts and , ultimately , bone resorption . \n the notion that healthy fibroblasts in the periodontium could play an important role in providing sustainable inflammatory mediators in the transition from gingivitis to periodontitis has also recently been discussed , although such cells would not be expected in the peri - implant compartment . \n thus , in order to address our question , we started with the premise that the peri - implant tissues surrounding the microgap are normal and healthy at the time of healing abutment connection . \n we further assumed that bacterial products would act on cells in the supra - bony soft tissue , and thus we investigated the effect of lps on cytokine expression and secretion in macrophages , stromal cells , and gingival fibroblasts . to qualify our lps model \n , we first undertook some comparative studies to assess the effects of laboratory produced , porphyromonas gingivalis ( p. gingivalis ) , prevotella intermedia ( p. intermedia ) , and commercially available , escherichia coli ( e. coli ) , lps on human gingival fibroblasts , since concern has recently been raised over the use of  home made  lps preparations . \n samples of gingival tissues were obtained , with informed consent , from 5 patients who showed no clinical signs of periodontal disease . \n the tissues were collected from different sites : ( 1 ) the palate , used for free connective tissue gingival grafting ; ( 2 ) the marginal gingivae , following extraction of third molars ; ( 3 ) the gingiva around dental implants during 2nd stage surgery . \n the collected tissue was washed 3 times with -mem supplemented with penicillin g ( 167  units / ml ) , gentamicin ( 50  g / ml ) , and 10% fbs , following which it was cut into small pieces and digested with a mixture of 3  mg / ml collagenase type 1 ( sigma - aldrich ) and 4  mg / ml trypsin in sm for 1 hour at 37 degrees . \n the digested tissue was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1150  rpm , and the supernatant was discarded . \n then , 10  ml of sm was added to the tube containing the pellet , and the cell suspension was transferred to a t-75 culture flask . \n when cells reached 8090% confluence , they were passaged to new t-75 flasks and plated at a concentration of 1.0  10  cells / cm in 6-well plates at passage 3 . \n two healthy volunteers , a 35-year -

cd14 , human mhc ii , and fitc - conjugated mouse igg ( all from bd scientific ) . \n hbmcs were obtained , following local research ethics board ( reb ) approval , from the collection kit filters ( baxter , deerfield , il , usa ) normally discarded following harvesting of bone marrow , from healthy donors , for transplantation . \n the cells were washed with pbs and then plated in 75  cm flasks in 10  ml of sm . \n when cells achieved 7080% confluency , they were trypsinized ( 0.25% trypsin in pbs at 37 degrees for 5 minutes ) , harvested , and expanded in new 75  cm flasks . \n cells were expanded to achieve 8085% confluency at passage 1 through passage 4 . at this stage , \n the hbmcs were suspended in sm and seeded at a concentration of 1.0  10  cells / cm in 6-well plates at passage 4 . \n we collected filters from six different donor aspirates and repeated the hbmcs culture procedures six times . \n the mouse macrophage cell line , raw 264.7 ( atcc , manassas , va , usa ) , was initially suspended in fresh supplemented medium ( sm ) composed of 10% fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) ( hyclone , logan , ut , usa ) , 80% dmem ( atcc ) and 10% antibiotics ( 167  units / ml penicillin g , 50  g / ml gentamicin ) , and 0.3  g / ml fungizone ( all sigma - aldrich , st . \n subsequently , the cells were plated in 75  cm ( t-75 ) polystyrene tissue culture flasks ( bd , franklin lakes , nj , usa ) , and incubated at 37 degrees with 5% co2 . \n the cells grew to 80% confluency , as observed by inverted phase microscopy , after which they were washed with pbs ( gibco , carlsbad , ca , usa ) and removed from the culture flask after the addition of 2.5  ml 0.25% trypsin ( gibco ) in pbs for 5 minutes at 37 degrees . to inactivate the trypsin , 5  ml \n sm was added , and the cell suspension was then centrifuged at 1150  rpm for 5 minutes . \n the total viable cell count was obtained from a vicell - xr automated cell counter ( beckman coulter , fullerton , ca , usa ) . \n this cell culture protocol was followed for cell expansion from passage 0 to passage 2 . on passage 3 \n , raw 264.7 cells were plated at a concentration of 2.0  10  cells / well in 6-well plates . \n the harvested femora were soaked and washed for 10 minutes three times with -mem medium ( gibco ) supplemented with 10% antibiotics ( as above ) . \n both epiphyses were cut off and the bone marrow was gently flushed out from both sides with a 10  ml syringe ( fitted with a 20-gauge needle ) filled with fully supplemented medium ( fsm : 10% fbs , 80% -mem and 10% antibiotics ) . \n the volume of bone marrow suspension was adjusted to 30  ml with fsm and divided in two aliquots of 15  ml each , which were distributed in two t-75 flasks . \n the first medium change was done at 24 hours and then three times per week subsequently . \n cells were grown for 5 to 6 days to 8085% confluence . at each passage , and up to passage 8 , 1.0  10 ^ 6 cells were collected and fixed with formalin in a 1.5  ml microcentrifuge tube for flow cytometry ( beckman coulter , miami , fl , usa ) analysis of the cd45 positive cell population ( cd45 , mouse anti - rat caltag laboratories , burlingame , ca , usa ) , for investigation of the presence of hematopoietic cells . aliquots of 2.0  10 ^ 6  cells / cm of the rsbmcs at passage 7 were seeded into 6-well plates . \n the passage 7 was chosen in this assay because passage 7 included only 0.36% of cd45 cells . \n stromal cells were isolated from bone marrow of two rats for quantification of cd45 cells . \n hgfs were stimulated with different types of lps : p. gingivalis , p. intermedia , and e. coli lps ( escherichia coli 055:b5 , sigma - aldrich ) . \n both lps of p. gingivals and p. intermedia were isolated from colonies of these bacterial cultures . \n the strains used in this study were p. intermedia atcc 25611 , p. gingivalis atcc 33277 . \n all anaerobes were maintained on brucella hk agar ( kyokuto , tokyo , japan ) supplemented with 5% laked sheep blood in an atmosphere of 80% n2 , 10% co2 , and 10% h2o in the aerobic chamber for 48 hours 37 degrees . \n lps was extracted by using an lps extraction kit ( intron biotechnology , kyunggi - do , korea ) , dissolved in 10  mm tris - hcl buffer , and freeze - dried . in separate experiments , hbmcs and hgfs \n were stimulated with e. coli lps ( 0  g / ml or 0.1  g / ml or 1  g / ml ) for 24 , 48 , or 96 hours , and they were stimulated with p. gingivalis lps or p. intermedia lps ( 1  g / ml ) for 2 or 24 hours ( 37 degrees , 5% co2 ) . \n raw 264.7 cells were stimulated with e. coli lps ( escherichia coli 055:b5 , sigma - aldrich ) ( 0  g / ml or 1  g / ml ) for 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , and 60 hours ; hmo were stimulated with lps ( 0  g / ml or 1  g / ml ) for 24 hours ; rsbmcs were stimulated with e. coli lps ( 0  g / ml or 0.1  g / ml or 1  g / ml ) for 6 , 24 , 48 and 96 hours ; hbmcs and hgfs were stimulated with e. coli lps ( 0  g / ml or 0.1  g / ml or 1  g / ml ) for 24 , 48 , and 96 hours . in each case , lps was added to the culture medium when cells reached 7580% confluence , which was approximately at day 3 for mmo and day 7 for rsbmcs , hgfs , and hbmcs . \n cell culture supernatants of hbmcs and hgfs were harvested and stored at 80 degrees prior to enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa , thermo fisher scientific , waltham , ma , usa ) . \n rna was isolated from both lps stimulated cells and cell , lysate after the culture medium was removed ( see below ) . \n total cellular rna was extracted from hbmcs , hgfs , , hmo , mmo and rsbmcs . with 1  ml/10  cm culture dish area of tri reagent ( ambion , austin , tx , usa ) . \n cdna templates of these cells were produced using a reverse transcriptase kit ( quanti tect reverse transcription kit , qiagen , mississauga , on , usa ) . \n gapdh , a house - keeping gene , was used for all species of human , rat , and mouse . \n specific primers of il-1 , il-1 , tnf- , il-6 , rank , rankl , trl-2 , \n trl-4 , cd14 and md-2 were designed for human or rat , and mouse individually using an electronic gene database ( blast , national library of medicine ) . \n the specific primers ( table 1 ) were added to each cdna sample to be amplified using a taq polymerase kit ( platinum taq dna polymerase , invitrogen , carisbad , ca , usa ) . \n expression of cdna was assessed by running 25 to 35 cycles at 55 degrees to 65 degrees on reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) amplification . \n amplified products were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized with ethidium bromide ( sigma - aldrich ) staining . \n culture supernatants from each cell type were removed and stored at 80 degrees prior to elisa analysis . \n elisa kits were used to quantify il-1 , il-1 , tnf- , and il-6 concentration in cell - free culture supernatants according to the manufacturer 's protocols . \n hbmcs and hgfs were extracted with a lysis buffer ( cell signaling technology , beverly , ms , usa ) and the protein lysates were stored in the same manner . \n elisa kits were used to quantify il-1 , il-1 , and tnf- concentration in cell lysates according to the manufacturer 's protocols . \n the absorbance at 450  nm was read with wavelength correction set at 550  nm . \n the sensitivities of the commercial elisa kits were < 2  pg / ml for il-1 , < 1  pg / ml for il-1 , < 2  pg / ml for tnf- , and < 1  pg / ml for il-6 . \n the number of samples of cell - free culture supernatant samples , the cell lysate samples , and the times of repeated analysis of each sample are shown in table 2 . \n the concentration of il-1 , il-1 , il-6 , and tnf- was analyzed in cell - free culture supernatants and the cell lysate for hbmcs and hgfs . in hmo , we analyzed only the concentration of il-1 and il-1.   mmo ( raw 264.7 ) were washed with pbs and fixed with 10% formalin at room temperature for 5 minutes . \n then , they were washed with distilled water and incubated in michaelis veronal acetate buffer ( ph 5.0 ) containing naphtol as - bi phosphate as substrate , pararosanilin - hcl as coupler , and tartaric acid for detection of trap activity , for 40 minutes at 37 degrees . \n they were analyzed and counted in micrographs taken with a digital camera attached to the light microscope . \n mmo cells in a 96-well plate were washed with pbs and add 100  l / well of the assay solution : 1  ml of 0.1  m pnpp ( disodium p - nitrophenylphophate hexahydrate ) , 1  ml of 10 buffer ( 1  m sodium acetate and 0.1  m sodium tartrate ) , 1  ml of 0.1% triton - x , and fill up to 10  ml with distilled water . \n incubate the plate for 10 minutes at room temperature and add 50  l / well of 0.2  m naoh as a stop solution . then , measure the absorbance at 405  nm . \n the osteoclastic bone resorption assay was performed using the commercially available osteologic culture system ( biocoat osteologic bone cell culture system , bd ) , in which the substrate is coated with a thin layer of osteoclast resorbable calcium phosphate ceramic . \n raw 264.7 cells ( 1.0  10 ^ 4  cells / well ) were cultured on the osteologic plates for 1 day . \n then , lps ( 1  g / ml ) , or rankl ( receptor activator of nuclear factor b ligand ) ( 200  ng / ml ) was added to the cell culture medium , and cells were stimulated with either lps or rankl for 7 days . \n after 7 days , the cell culture medium was removed and cells were fixed with 10% formalin . \n we investigated the effects of different types of lps on pro - inflammatory and osteoclastogenic cytokine gene expression following exposure to lps for 2 hours in hgf . \n all three lps types ( derived from e.coli , p. gingivalis , p. intermedia . ) showed similar upregulation of il-1 , il-6 , and rankl gene expression ( figures 1(b ) , 1(c ) , and 1(e ) ) . \n tnf- and rankl expression was detected in both non - lps and lps conditions ( figures 1(d ) and 1(f ) ) . \n we next examined the effects of lps on the trl 2 and trl 4 lps receptors and their signaling cascade factors ( figure 2(a ) ) . without lps , \n this was also the case for cd-14 gene expression , although md-2 was expressed with or without lps stimulation ( figure 2(b ) ) . \n therefore , for convenience , we selected e. coli lps for subsequent experiments as it is commercially available . \n however , our experimental purpose was to investigate the cellular influence on osteoclastogenesis in the surrounding tissue cells . \n therefore , we also examined the effect of macrophages and bone marrow cells , which could be expected to exist around dental implant fixtures , from human , mouse , and rat . \n hmo expressed il-1 and tnf- gene in the presence or absence of lps for 24 hours at 35 cycles of rt - pcr ( figure 3 ) . \n both il-1 and il-6 expression was increased by lps stimulation in human macrophages at 30 cycles of rt - pcr ( figure 3 ) . \n mmo cultures showed that the expression of il-1 , il-1 , and il-6 genes was upregulated with lps stimulation at 30 cycles of rt - pcr ( figure 4 ) . \n however , gene expression of tnf- was observed irrespective of lps stimulation at all time points , except for 60 hours ( figure 4 ) . \n the il-1 and il-6 gene expression decreased at 48 hours , while il-1 gene expression was decreased at 60 hours after lps stimulation ( figure 4 ) . \n hbmcs showed a similar trend for gene expression of cytokines as that found with rsbmcs ( figure 5 ) . \n the gene expression of il-1 , il-1 , and il-6 was stimulated by the presence of lps . \n however , the expression of il-1 and il-1 gene was reduced at 96 hours in hbmcs culture . \n tnf- gene expression also occurred in the presence of lps at 24 hours and 48 hours ( figure 5 ) . nevertheless , the tnf- expression was very weak at each lps concentration and time point . \n the lps - stimulated genes for il-1 and il-1 were observed by rt - pcr at 30 cycles , and for il-6 gene at 25 cycles . \n lps upregulated gene expression of il-1 , il-1 , and il-6 during the rsbmcs poststimulation period ( 696 hours , figure 6 ) , showing the same trend of mmo cultures . \n the expression of tnf- gene in the presence of lps at 6 and 48 hours at 30 cycles was very weak ( figure 6 ) . running cycles for rt - pcr were same as hbmcs . \n although we used hgf for estimating the effect of different lps in this study , those experiments were carried out with 2 hours lps exposure . \n we also investigated the lps effects against hgf with longer time periods , 24 , 48 , and 96 hours , in a subsequent experiment . \n all genes , for il-1 , il-1 , tnf- , and il-6 , were expressed in the presence of lps at all time points in hgf cultures . however , \n expression of il-1 was not expressed at 96 hours in spite of increased ( + 5 ) cycles ; the expression of il-1 , il-1 , and tnf- was observed at 35 cycles . \n interestingly , all gene expression was stronger at 0.1  g / ml than at 1  g / ml lps ( figure 7 ) . \n lps - stimulated il-1 and il-1 gene expression was reduced in a time - dependent manner , however , il-6 gene expression increased especially with 1  g / ml concentration of lps ( figure 7 ) . \n elisa was used to assess levels of protein secretion ( il-1 , il-1 , tnf- , and il-6 ) in cultures of hmos , hbmcs , and hgfs . \n significant secretion of il-1 and il-1 was found in the cell - free culture supernatant after stimulation with lps for 24 hours ( table 3(a ) ) . il-1 and il-1 concentrations were approximately 470 times and 12.5 times higher in the presence of lps . \n the analysis of cell lysate by elisa revealed that lps - stimulated hbmcs secreted il-1 at 24 hours and il-1 at 24 , 48 , and 96 hours ( table 3(b ) ) but these protein levels were very low . \n secretions of tnf- from protein lysate were detected both with and without lps at all time points ( table 3(b ) ) . \n thus , the secretion of il-1 , il-1 , and tnf- was meaningless in hbmcs cultures .   to the contrary , the level of il-6 secretion was extremely high in the presence of lps in hbmcs ( figure 8(a ) ) . \n il-6 concentration was approximately 40000 times higher at 96 hours in the presence of lps as maximum compared to absence of lps . \n the secretions of il-6 from cell - free culture supernatants were detected from only with lps at all time points ( figure 8(a ) ) . \n therefore , the secretion of il-6 protein was induced by lps stimulation in a time - dependent manner , but not an lps dose - dependent manner . \n secretion of tnf- was not specific to the presence of lps stimulation at 24 , 48 , and 96 hours ( table 3(c ) ) . \n the levels of il-6 protein were clearly increased with lps in hgfs ( figure 8(b ) ) . \n the secretions of il-6 were detected from cell - free culture supernatants at all time points : 24 , 48 and 96 hours . \n secretion of il-6 by hgfs in the presence of lps stimulation was found to be time- and dose - dependent hgfs ( figure 8(b ) ) . \n mmo ( raw 264.7 cells ) were cultured in medium with 300  ng / ml gst - rankl for 3 days demonstrated the highest trap positive reaction compared to negative controls , without rankl , and lps stimulated mmo ( figure 9 ) . \n mmo were cultured in medium containing 1  g / ml lps for 5 to 7 days and observed under phase contrast for the presence of multinucleated cells ( mncs ) ( figure 10(b ) ) . \n the mncs were enlarged the size , but the amount of mncs was decreased at day 7 . \n mmo did not show morphological changes in the absence of lps ( figure 10(a ) ) . \n osteoclast formation was examined by trap staining , which is a selectable staining to identify osteoclasts and activated macrophages . \n trap - positive mononuclear cells and mncs were observed in mmo cultures in the presence of lps ( figure 10(e ) ) and in the presence of rankl ( figure 10(h ) ) . \n mmo cultures without the addition of lps or rankl were used as negative control and did not show positive reaction to trap staining ( figure 10(c ) ) . \n mmo cultures stimulated with rankl were used as a positive control ( figure 10(h ) ) . \n pit forming activity was analyzed using the commercially available biocoat osteologic bone cell culture system ( osteologic ) , which consists of quartz plates with a thin film surface coating of calcium phosphate ( cap ) . \n pit formation on the cap substrates was observed in mouse macrophage cultures in the presence of lps ( figure 10(f ) ) and rankl ( figure 10(g ) ) . \n although gingival and periodontal pathologies are known to cause the upregulation and secretion of pro - inflammatory cytokines , [ 3436 ] our studies were aimed at elucidating a mechanism whereby dental implants , placed in healthy tissue , and could cause the genesis of osteoclasts that would be the effectors of peri - implant crestal bone loss . since the latter is a local , not systemic phenomenon , \n thus , we hypothesized that bacterial products , originating from bacteria colonizing implant / abutment connections , could cause the upregulation of pro - inflammatory cytokines in the cells of healthy peri - implant tissues that would , in turn , stimulate the recruitment of resorptively active osteoclasts . \n indeed , our results show that e. coli lps , as a model bacterial endotoxin , can selectively stimulate the upregulation of pro - inflammatory cytokines in healthy candidate resident cells , which can cause the genesis of osteoclasts that are resorptively active .   despite differences in implant / abutment designs , implant / abutment connections will invariably form a microgap , that under function ( cyclic opening / closing ) , will allow passage of organic fluids containing bacteria and endotoxin from and to the implant cavities . \n furthermore , the bacterial colonization of the internal cavities of two piece dental implants has been repeatedly demonstrated through both microscopical observations and in vitro studies [ 35 ] . \n in fact , it is likely that these cavities provide anaerobic chambers for pathogens that could induce an immune response in the host . \n the intensity of such response would depend on : the immunologic profile of each individual ( as is known to be the case in periodontal disease ) ; the amount and types of periodontal pathogens present in the mouth ; possibly , the position ( in relation to the bone crest ) of the implant / abutment interface [ 11 , 13 ] . \n indeed , there seems to be a delicate balance between cytokines that trigger immunological response ( pro - inflammatory ) and those that will modulate the immunological response . \n interestingly , clinical studies of implant / abutment self - locking connections [ 39 , 40 ] , which are more stable and reduce fluid percolation ( with respect to the less stable flat - to - flat nonself - locking components ) , have shown a reduction in the overall loss of crestal bone . \n our results show that lps upregulated il-1 and il-6 gene expression in all the examined cells types ; while il- , and tnf- were only upregulated in cultures of hbmcs , and hgfs . \n on the contrary , analysis of protein secretion showed very low or undetectable levels il-1 , il-1 and tnf- in cultures of hm , hbmcs and hgfs . \n however , there was a clear increase in il-6 secretion , with lps treatment , for both hbmcs and hgfs , a finding that corresponds to previous reports [ 41 , 42 ] . \n indeed , il-6 has been shown to stimulate osteoclast activity through enhancement of the expression of rankl with soluble il-6 receptors ( sil-6r ) in both calvarial bones   and osteoblasts , an effect reliant on the synergistic effect of il-6 and sil-6r . furthermore \n , il-6 can stimulate osteoclast - like formation in long - term human bone marrow cultures by inducing il-1 release . \n thus , il-6 might be responsible for osteoclast differentiation and activation through enhancement of rankl expression [ 4345 ] . \n gingival tissues obtained from diseased periodontal sites contain higher levels of il-6 as compared to healthy sites   and crevicular fluid from periodontally diseased sites contain more il-6 than healthy sites . while il- , il-10 , il-12 , il-8 , il-6 , and tnf- have all been found to be present in peri - implant crevicular fluid , recorded levels tended to be higher than those observed around teeth ,   and il-6 expression is stimulated by il-1 and tnf- in hgfs \n osteoblasts have also been shown to produce il-6 in response to local bone - resorbing agents . \n thus , it is likely that il-6 , in cooperation with other cytokines , plays a role in the bone   destruction and tissue damage . \n in fact , increases in inflammatory cytokines are associated with bone loss and progressive failure of dental implants [ 50 , 51 ] . \n since cytokines are small molecules of short life span and short acting distance  which can produce responses in very small concentrations and in a paracrine fashion this may explain why the recent introduction of platform switching in implant design [ 53 , 54 ] contains the pro - inflammatory cytokine production to the area between the abutment and platform ; thereby shielding the surrounding bone from their deleterious effects . \n in comparison to the specific expression and abundant secretion of il-6 by hbmcs and hgfs , it is noteworthy that low amounts of il-1 , il-1 , and tnf- were also produced and secreted . \n the il-1 and il-1 have been shown to enhance rankl expression in both osteoblasts and stromal cells [ 44 , 45 ] , while il-1 promotes the survival of osteoclasts through nf - kb activation which results in induction of osteoclast activation . \n tnf- stimulates the differentiation and survival of osteoclasts , but not the function of osteoclasts . \n thus , the differentiation and activation of osteoclasts could be stimulated by lps through il-1 , il-1 , and tnf-. our results show that lps activated macrophages can form resorptively active osteoclast - like trap positive cells and suggest that lps may have a direct action on resident macrophages in addition to its known ability to act indirectly on preosteoclasts . \n taken together , our results support the hypothesis that bacterial endotoxins may upregulate pro - inflammatory genes in a number of resident cells found in the healthy peri - implant compartment , and , that the local synergistic action of cytokines secreted by such cells result in the genesis of resorptively active osteoclasts .", 8032, 335, "arxiv"], [118, "Suggest two possible alternatives for this item.\n\nAdvil", 11, 8, "alpaca"], [119, "I recall that somewhere in Plato there is a discussion about the origins of writing. one critique that was addressed to that invetion is that it would undermine the art of memory. please find that passage.", 41, 144, "sharegpt"], [163, "Create a dialogue that illustrates a disagreement between two characters.", 11, 123, "alpaca"], [121, "I need to create a website to create a database where recorded customers, new and old customers, and when they will have an appointment.\nThe database will record name, telephone number, date of appointment and time of the appointment.

has led to a pandemic - like situation all over the globe . \n the world health organization estimates that for every 6 s , somebody dies from a tobacco - related disease globally , and this deadly habit is mainly learnt at home . the socio - environmental factors prevailing at home have been identified as one of the important causes of adopting smoking and other types of smokeless tobacco . \n identification of predictors for the initiation of tobacco use is essential to curb the issue . like genetically linked disease run in families , \n tobacco users in families also tend to influence their siblings and relatives for initiation of tobacco . \n role of family covers a bigger arena than society , peers , and other reasons for the initiation of tobacco use . the first lesson of smoking and tobacco consumption is usually learnt at home from a parent or a grown - up sibling , especially if the habit is acquired at an early age before 18 years . \n reports have shown that initiation of tobacco use during adolescence causes more tobacco dependence . during their formative phase , \n kids who see their parents , elders , and siblings smoking or chewing tobacco become inquisitive , and their minds get primed and conditioned to initiate smoking , at quite a young age . \n once the habit of tobacco consumption is acquired at young age , it is difficult to get rid of it because of its addictive nature . \n one not only inherits the habit of smoking from parents / elders , but also passes on the baton to the next generation . \n although several nation - wide prevalence studies such as the national family health survey and global adult tobacco survey report the proportion of population using tobacco products in india , role of family has not been discussed much . moreover , \n the degree of inheritance of smoking practices from parents and further continuation in those practices in the offspring has not been studied previously . \n study on the role of family practices for initiation of tobacco use is lacking in india and abroad . \n we hypothesized that tobacco use is associated with family practices and can influence tobacco use behavior in the family . \n this study was conducted to determine the prevalence and pattern of tobacco use in the patients registered in the clinic . \n an attempt was also made to examine the role of parental and family influence on tobacco use . \n findings will stimulate and inform the creation , implementation , evaluation of targeted dependence prevention , and cessation strategies and programs . \n the study was conducted between january 2014 and december 2014 and included all 307 patients who were registered in a cardiac clinic . in the present study , \n all the patients who came to the cardiac clinic during the study period and were eligible , as per inclusion criteria of the study , were included and no sampling was done . \n only the adult patients ( more than 18 years of age ) attending the clinic were interviewed . \n the history of tobacco use in siblings , offspring , and parents was taken from these patients only . \n patients who were unwilling to participate and those who were unable to respond to the questions ( due to hearing problem or any other reason ) were excluded . written informed consent was obtained from the respondents after explaining the nature and objectives of the study in their local language . \n the study was approved by the institutional review board and institutional ethics committee of jamia hamdard . \n data were collected by interview method using pretested and predesigned semi - structured pro forma having questions pertaining to sociodemographic details , tobacco use , and history of tobacco use in family and siblings . \n they were classified as current tobacco users ( use tobacco regularly for within 1 month before examination ) and nontobacco users ( had never used tobacco ) . \n those who took alcohol more than 5 times in a week were classified as regular users and those took only on occasions were classified as occasional alcohol users . \n the data were analyzed using spss 22 ibm spss statistics for windows , version 22.0 . \n use of tobacco was considered as dependent variable and its use in parents , siblings , and offspring was taken as an independent variable . \n chi - square test was done to assess significance ; p < 0.05 was taken as significant . \n there were 307 patients who attended the cardiac clinic at the tertiary care hospital in delhi . \n there were 196 ( 64% ) males and 111 ( 36% ) females . among them , 65% were hindus . \n of the 307 patients , 108 ( 35% ) were tobacco users and 161 ( 52% ) patients were nonusers of tobacco . among the tobacco users , 38 ( 13% ) patients managed to quit smoking or using other forms of tobacco after counseling , so they were categorized as ex - users of tobacco [ table 1 ] . \n profile of patients who attended the clinic in the overall study population , 15% of the patients were using cigarette , 7.9% were consuming bidi , 14% were taking smokeless forms of tobacco , and 10.7% were using mixed form whereas 52.4% were not using any form of tobacco . \n gender - wise analysis of the use of various forms of tobacco revealed that 79% of females were not using tobacco in any form whereas 5.3% were using cigarettes , 5.3% were taking bidi , 8.7% and 1.8% were taking smokeless tobacco and mixed forms , respectively . majority ( 64% ) of males used smoked and smokeless forms of tobacco [ table 2 ] . \n distribution of patients as per the different forms of tobacco used and as per their gender to examine the hypothesis that tobacco habit runs in families , the family history , the practice of this habit in parents , siblings , and offspring of the tobacco users and nontobacco users were evaluated . \n table 3 shows the distribution of patients as per their tobacco use profile and family practices of those who were using tobacco . among tobacco users , the family history of tobacco use was present in 81% and one of the parents of 63.8% was using tobacco . \n thus , family practices related to tobacco use varied widely among the tobacco users and nonusers . \n distribution of patients as per their tobacco use profile and family profile in the study population , both mother and father were using tobacco in 8% of families . \n history of tobacco use by fathers was seen in 42 ( 52% ) and 14 patients ( 3% ) had a history of tobacco use by mothers compared to 36% with a history of tobacco use by none . \n the use of tobacco among either of the parents in tobacco users was higher than in nontobacco users and it was statistically significant [ table 4 ] . \n all the 36 patients who reported a history of tobacco use by their mothers were tobacco users . \n odds ratio of tobacco use was 9.7 ( 5.42217.445 ) times more in the participants whose either of the parents was tobacco users than the nonusers . \n

found to be similar . \n percentage of use of smokeless tobacco and cigarette was seen to increase in offspring and siblings . \n the percentage of nonusers were found to be nearly same in parents , siblings , and offspring of the participants . \n profile of different forms of tobacco use in families of the study population among the patients , 16% were regular alcohol users and 27.4% were occasional users . out of the 146 tobacco users , 82 ( 56% ) \n a significant association was found between the practices of smoking and alcohol [ table 6 ] . among the 82 patients with tobacco and alcohol use , 61 ( 74.3% ) \n in this study , half of the patients were found to be tobacco users and among tobacco users , the family history of tobacco use was present in the majority and in more than half of the participants , there was a history of tobacco use by parents . \n this study is one of the few studies which has studied the entire spectrum of tobacco habit in three generations that included bidi smoking , cigarette smoking , and use of smokeless tobacco or both . \n for example , a teenager will think twice before smoking in front of his parents , but will not hesitate to chew gutka or pan masala . in some cases , parents may also share the smokeless form of tobacco with siblings and offspring . among tobacco habits , chewing tobacco , consuming pan masala , gutka , and other smokeless tobacco are socially sanctioned behavior . \n therefore , its control is more difficult compared to smoking , which is seen as contempt by elders . \n however , when parents smoke or use tobacco products , they are not in a position to restrain their offspring . \n tobacco and alcohol addictive habits are reported to be acquired at an early age in family surroundings . in our study \n our study also reveals that increased frequency of drinking was also associated with tobacco use . \n ozawa et al . also observed that an increase in drinking frequency resulted in less likelihood of smoking cessation . \n this finding raises an issue that with the growing percentage of tobacco use , alcohol intake will also increase and vice versa . \n therefore , the need is to address both the issues together . in our study , \n 45.5% of the patients were tobacco users and 81% of those who were using tobacco had a positive family history . \n parents generally have much longer and more frequent contact with their children than any peer claiming to have influence over them \n . most parents usually remain throughout one 's adolescence , while peers or best friends change frequently . \n done on 3000 high school children also found that incidence of smoking among high school students significantly correlated with the incidence of smoking among family members ( p < 0.001 ) . in another study , talay and altin have also observed that smoking rates seem to be influenced by smoking habits of family members . \n . use of smokeless tobacco among parents and their effect on siblings and offspring has not been described much by western authors ; the reason being smokeless tobacco is mainly consumed in the indian subcontinent . \n ozawa et al . found that paternal and maternal smoking had a significant impact on whether or not a child would quit smoking as compared to a child that had paternal and maternal nonsmokers . \n shamsuddin and haris and dwivedi et al . also showed that effect of the father 's smoking habit on the child 's current smoking habit is significant , even after controlling for other familial and nonfamilial factors , including parental supervision , academic performance , reported influence of cigarette advertisement , and having friends who smoked . \n our study also showed that among tobacco users , 65.8% reportedly had a history of tobacco use by fathers . \n bders in a review has suggested that parental influence might include other factors such as parents approval or disapproval of smoking , their involvement in free time supervision , their manner , and extent of communication on health - related issues . \n the most dominant role is played by mother in early initiation of smoking or tobacco use by offspring . \n the logic behind such hypothesis is that if a mother has been smoking , the fetus passively inhales nicotine and carbon monoxide through placenta while in mother 's womb . soon after delivery \n , the baby is again subjected to passive smoking while in the lap of the mother during breastfeeding or otherwise . the visual impact on brain during immediate neonatal period , \n i.e. , seeing one 's own mother smoking , is something which has not been studied extensively , but one can safely surmise that such children will emulate smoking much earlier than those whose mothers have not been smoking during pregnancy and subsequent period . \n it has also been observed that the brain of the fetus whose mother is a smoker gets primed for nicotine craving and smoking during their adolescence . \n the resultant effect is that most offspring of such parents would adopt smoking early and be the victims of premature coronary artery disease and other tobacco - related diseases . \n the combined ill - effect of maternal smoking / passive smoking is not only epigenetic and priming to the fetus , but also adventurous and fascinating , finally resulting in addictive habit as early as 6 or 7 years of age . \n overall , maternal smoking was more strongly associated with youths regular smoking than paternal smoking in the present study . \n these results suggest that efforts to decrease the burden of tobacco smoking among youths may be more efficient if focused on families rather than on individuals . \n , we could only interview patients who had come to the clinic and history of tobacco use in siblings or parents , and offspring could only be elicited by asking them ; therefore , there can be recall bias . \n the study was a hospital - based study , so the participants may not be representative of the general population . \n the results of this study expand our understanding of the influence of parental tobacco use and intergenerational transmission of this habit . \n the study also throws light on how tobacco users in the family tend to influence offspring and siblings . \n an attempt has been made to quantify the degree of intergenerational transmission of tobacco habit . \n the data provide an exact estimate of the burden of tobacco use by an individual that can be attributed to tobacco use habits of the parents . a deeper understanding of this transmission of tobacco use will provide further insight into the avenues of prevention , in particular , family - based interventions and those that emphasize assisting parents in cessation efforts that will not only reduce the parent 's use , but also likely reduce uptake of tobacco use in subsequent generations . \n the study also addresses the fact that problem of tobacco use and alcohol use needs to be targeted together to bring a gigantic change in lifestyle diseases . \n previous anti - smoking campaigns have concentrated much of their effort on discouraging individuals from smoking with the aim of creating a nonsmoking generation . \n this approach does not take sufficient account of the fact , reconfirmed by our findings that children are influenced by the behavior and attitudes of adults , especially their parents . \n the most effective way to stop children smoking may be to discourage smoking among adults in the family . \n future health education efforts should not consider children in isolation , but rather as a part of a society in which smokeless tobacco and tobacco smoking is still an acceptable adult behavior . there are no conflicts of interest

ceramic crowns were introduced for use in cosmetic restorative treatment where substantial crown destruction exists . \n it is known that composite resins are widely preferred as they allow for more conservative and direct placement compared to other materials , and as they enable the restoration to be completed in a single session . however , composite resin restorations have certain disadvantages as well as including the difficulty to form bonds while working in the oral cavity , sensitivity to moisture , microleakage , or marginal gap formation due to polymerization shrinkage \n . the restoration of large cavities can be accomplished by extraoral polymerization of the resin composite or using the layering technique to avoid polymerization shrinkage and associated problems . \n secondary polymerization by heat curing strengthens the physical properties of the material , the process that prevents the formation of monomers and associated problems that could arise . \n enabling secondary polymerization by heat curing not only reinforces the physical properties of the material but also prevents residual monomer formation and problems which may arise correspondingly . \n inlay / onlay systems using composite resin or ceramic blocks combine the advantages of the secondary polymerization method that employ light or heat curing . \n our study evaluated the clinical performance of the indirect composite versus compomer resin placement in the restoration of primary teeth with extensive loss of tooth structure . \n seventeen patients ( 7 girls and 10 boys ) were selected among the children between 4 and 8 years of age admitted to our clinic , who did not have any medical problems or bad habits , and who scored 3 or 4 according to the frankl behavior scale . \n a total of 48 first and second primary molar teeth ( 33 located in the lower jaw and 15 in the upper jaw ) were included in the study . \n clinical and radiographic evaluations were conducted on teeth for which an onlay restoration was planned using the indirect method . \n radiographic images and intraoral photos of the relevant tooth / teeth were obtained from the patients selected for radiologic evaluation , and oral hygiene level ( oral hygiene index - simplified [ ohi - s ] ) and the depth of gingival sulcus were measured and recorded before onlay restoration and after treatment at control visits . \n after the preparation of the cavity onlay , a cavity impression was created by taking the measurement using condensation -

operated group ( figures 2 and 3 ) . in the sci group , il-17 and p - stat3 integrated optical density ( iod ) were higher than the sham - operated group ( p < 0.05 ) ( figures 2 and 3 ) . \n we used western blotting analyses to determine activation of the stat3 signaling pathway after sci . \n antibodies against p - stat3 detected a single protein band in the crude samples of injured spinal cord , similar to the sham - operated group in all detected groups . \n densitometric analysis of p - stat3 at tyr705 bands revealed an increased expression after sci immediately , peaking at 24  h and gradually decreasing thereafter , while p - stat3 was hardly detected in control groups ( figure 4 ) . \n statistical significance was seen from 1 to 72  h after sci compared with the control value ( p < 0.05 ) . \n rt - pcr was used to detect the expressions of il-17 and il-23p19 mrna and its intensity was normalized against  -actin . for il-17 , \n the results in the sci group from 1  h to 72  h were 0.23    0.07 , 0.47    0.06 , 0.40    0.07 , and 0.31    0.04 . \n the il-17 mrna was clearly upregulated in rats with sci at 1  h and peaked at 24  h ( p < 0.05 ) . for il-23p19 mrna , \n the expression of spleen mrna in the sci group from 1  h to 72  h was 0.25    0.05 , 0.54    0.07 , 0.47    0.09 , and 0.39    0.07 . \n the il-23p19 mrna was clearly upregulated in rats with sci at 1  h and peaked at 24  h ( p < 0.05 ) ( figure 5 ) . \n there were increased expressions of il-6 , il-21 , and il-23 in the sci group from 1  h to 72  h and peaked at 24  h compared to the sham group ( figure 6 ) . \n our study succeeded in demonstrating the statistical correlation between p - stat3 and th17 cell related cytokines . \n immunohistochemistry demonstrated that p - stat3 concentration showed a positive correlation with the level of il-17 ( r = 0.5415 , p = 0.0054 ) in spinal cord tissue following sci . \n rt - pcr demonstrated that il-17 concentrations showed a positive correlation with the level of il-23p19 ( r = 0.6213 , p = 0.0135 ) in spleen tissue following sci . \n moreover , il-17 reached statistical significance with the level of il-6 ( r = 0.4735 , p = 0.026 ) , il-21 ( r = 0.5219 , p = 0.0419 ) , or il-23 ( r = 0.5017 , p = 0.0387 ) following sci . \n traumatic spinal cord injury results in the disruption of neural and vascular structures , which leads to inflammation and the initiation of secondary injury events defined secondary spinal cord injury . \n indeed , many experimental sci models have indicated that traumatic spinal cord injury is associated with long - lasting inflammation , which parallels the force of the insult and the severity of the functional deficit . \n currently , there is no treatment available for sci . because hemorrhage and subsequent inflammation result in a worse neurological outcome and larger lesion following sci , it is essential to study the secondary spinal cord injury to reduce the secondary damage in order to preserve motor function . \n an enhanced understanding of inflammation will preserve spinal cord tissue and neurons better , which may correct biochemical disorder at the immediate and distal sites of spinal cord injury , including the imbalance of inflammatory molecules and the loss in nerve function , thereby reducing secondary spinal cord degeneration . \n recent studies have identified il-17 ( th17 ) originated from the subset of t cells , which plays a predominant role in the pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis   and autoimmune arthritis [ 14 , 15 ] . while most nervous system disease pathogeneses are associated with autoimmune or immune inflammatory injury , \n the data clearly support the notion that both anti - inflammatory ( th2 or tregs ) and proinflammatory ( th1 or th17 ) t cells were activated in the context of a sterile sci . \n importantly , recent clinical trials with short duration il-17 antagonistic therapy in established rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) have provided the direct evidence in pathological role of il-17 in ra and indicated that blockade of il-17 in humans may represent a valid therapeutic approach . \n thus , we investigated whether the il-17 and il-17 related cytokines can affect secondary inflammatory reaction after spinal cord injury , which may provide a valid therapeutic approach for sci . \n in this study , we firstly observed that aberrant stat3 activation and il-17 related cytokines ' overexpression were involved in sci pathogenesis which may potentially aggravate this injury . \n the most common type of sci in the clinical practice is contusive spinal cord injury ; the weight drop rat model of sci described by allen is the most appropriate model to assess the acute sci . in this model , \n compared to the sham - operated group , hematoxylin - eosin staining results in the sci group exhibited marked neurons and organizational structure damage in the spinal cord tissues . \n furthermore , enhanced inflammatory infiltration and neuronal apoptosis were observed in the spinal cord tissue during sci . \n our previous studies have demonstrated that il-1 induces secondary inflammation of sci at 12  h . \n these data were consistent with the neuronal apoptosis observed in secondary sci in the rat model and the peak times were from 24  h to 72  h . \n in addition , compared to the sham - operated group , the protein expression level of il-17 in the sci group was higher and peaked at 24  h. consistently with these results , the mrna expression level of il-17 was increased after sci and peaked at 24  h in spleen tissue samples . \n totally , these data indicated that il-17 may play a very important role in the pathophysiology of sci . \n il-17 involved in the pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases required specific cytokines and transcription factors for their differentiation . specifically , il-6 and tgf- are recognized as crucial factors for t cells differentiation [ 20 , 21 ] . \n stat3 is known as a primary factor in the downstream signaling of il-6 , the phosphorylation of which induces proinflammatory gene expression [ 22 , 23 ] . \n furthermore , treg cell differentiation can be suppressed by il-6 via inhibition of the expression of foxp3 in a stat3-dependent manner and thereby contributes to immune pathology [ 24 , 25 ] . \n therefore , we assessed the phosphorylation of stat3 induced il-17 activation of cd4 t cells following sci to further study the underlying mechanisms of il-17/stat3 balance . \n interestingly , the sci group demonstrated increased protein levels of p - stat3 compared to the sham - operated group and peaked at 24  h. in addition , phosphorylation of stat3 expression was higher in the sci group and peaked at 24  h compared to the sham - operated group as assessed using immunohistochemistry . \n these data were consistent with the significant characteristics of the jak - stat signaling pathway , where metabolism quickly starts and disappears . under normal physiological conditions , jak - stat \n will momentarily be phosphorylated and this activation state only lasts for a few minutes to several hours . \n moreover , we observed that the sci group demonstrated an obvious increase in the phosphorylation of stat3 . \n as figures 2 and 3 are shown , the positive expression of il-17 and p - stat3 were both concentrated in the spinal cord neurons and astrocyte cells . \n considering the dynamic balance between the il-17 and p - stat3 , we further analyzed the correlation between il-17 and p - stat3 using spearman 's correlation analysis , which showed a positive correlation ( r = 0.5415 , p = 0.0009 ) in the immunohistochemistry results . \n in addition , our study on spleen tissues demonstrated a statistical correlation between p - stat3 protein levels and il-17 mrna , which also showed a positive correlation ( r = 0.5415 , p = 0.0009 ) . \n thus , we demonstrated that the stat3 signaling pathway was activated and induced by sci , suggesting that activation of p - stat3 might contribute to the effect on il-17 expression . \n the inflammatory response is an essential component of the repair process after spinal cord injury , which is associated with the upregulation of adhesion molecules , recruitment of inflammatory cells , growth factors , and cytokines . \n a variety of cytokines , including most interferons ( ifns ) , interleukins ( ils ) , and colony stimulating factors ( csfs ) , mediate their effects via the jak / stat pathway . \n currently , il-6 was recognized to be one of the key cytokines accelerating the il-17 production . \n as an autocrine growth factor , il-21 exerts critical functions in il-17 production and induces the differentiation of il-21-producing cd4 t cells . \n il-23 and il-17 are proinflammatory cytokines of the il-23/il-17 axis which may play a key role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases , such as il-17 proliferation , maintenance , and amplification . \n to gain insight into the mechanism underlying il-17 differentiation , il-17 mrna , il-23p19 mrna , and serum levels of il-6 , il-21 , and il-23 were measured in all animals . \n our data showed that the serum levels of il-6 , il-21 , and il-23 were increased at 1  h after injury and peaked at 24  h. il-17 mrna increased the circulating levels of il-17 and il-23p19 mrna and increased circulating il-6 , il-21 , and il-23 levels . \n consistent with this finding , the levels of il-23p19mrna expression were also increased . as a result , il-6 , il-21 , and il-23 \n to a large extent , the results of our study confirmed the hypothesis that , in the neuroinflammation of sci , il-6 , il-21 , and il-23 are produced in large quantities . \n these changes are more conductive to the production of il-17 and lead to immune disorder and promotion of sci . moreover , \n therefore , an interconnected loop is formed among spinal cord neuroinflammation factors , il-17 , stat3 signaling pathway , and il-17 related cytokines , which could influence each other and promote the development of spinal cord neuroinflammation . \n thereafter , we independently detected the protein level of il-17 and p - stat3 using immunohistochemistry . \n second , we focused on il-17 and its related cytokines il-6 , il-21 , and il-23 ; our study confirmed a positive correlation between il-17 and its related cytokines . \n furthermore , we did not show that il-17 came from the major cd4 t cell subset and we were unable to accomplish double staining for il-17 and p - stat3 . \n in addition , when stat3 signaling pathway is blocked , the expressions of il-17 and p - stat3 in spinal cord neuroinflammation after sci still need further investigation in our next experiments .", 5462, 317, "arxiv"], [132, "Please help me complete the long-text summarization task, where the long text is 'input' and the summarized result is 'output'.\n\nthe input is: the application of fibrinolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction is generally practiced to reduce the associated morbidities ; however , there are rare reports of pulmonary hemorrhage attributed to the use of fibrinolytic therapy throughout the literature . in this case report \n , we present a 45-year -

pink granules in paraganglionic tumors may lead to a misdiagnosis of medullary carcinoma thyroid . \n a misdiagnosis of neurogenic tumor is not unlikely when there is predominance of ovoid or spindle shaped nuclei in some pg . \n the uniform and benign looking chromatin pattern of the nucleus in paraganglioma helps in distinguishing it from metastatic carcinoma . in the retroperitoneal location , \n differential diagnoses include epithelial tumors such as renal cell carcinoma , adrenal cortical tumor , carcinoid tumor , islet - cell tumor , chordoma , and metastatic adenocarcinoma . \n in renal cell carcinoma , the cytoplasm is less fragile with more prominent vacuolization and cell borders are well - defined . \n adrenal cortical tumors show a lipid background and are comparatively less pleomorphic with tiny lipid droplets in the cytoplasm . \n the cytomorphologic features of chordoma are quite characteristic and show physaliferous cells in the background of chondroid matrix . \n occasionally , hepatocellular carcinoma , neurogenic tumors , sarcomas and melanoma may also enter into the differential diagnosis . \n radioimaging studies like ultrasound , ct scan with enhancement , magnetic resonance imaging and vascular imaging studies ; like doppler ultrasound and selective digital subtraction angiography are useful adjuncts to cytomorphology . \n these studies help in exact localization of eap and also define their relation with major blood vessels . \n cytomorphologic features like dispersed cell population with acinar pattern , plasmacytoid cells with salt and pepper nuclear chromatin and abundant granular vacuolated cytoplasm with indistinct cytoplasmic borders suggest a diagnosis of eap .", 2201, 379, "arxiv"], [146, "what are some good topics of conversation for esl students aged 10-13, lower intermediate level", 21, 289, "sharegpt"], [147, "It takes 20 minutes for John to go to the bathroom 8 times.

time pcr for tb results in early diagnosis and treatment , therefore , results in decreasing mortality and morbidity . \n our country is in the neighborhood of the area with endemic tb , and we have a lot of immigrants from those countries repeatedly . because of the pcr is so specific and considerably better than tb culture and smear our study was designed to evaluate tb pcr positive rate in patients who present with fairly long symptoms of meningitis . to answer this question : is there any tb pcr positive in cases with nontypical clinical picture of meningitis ? \n patients were recruited at alzahra hospital and kashani hospital , top referral hospitals in isfahan , iran . \n they had symptoms compatible with cns infection ( for example fever , headache , loss of consciousness , nausea , etc . ) with or without meningeal sign(s ) in physical examination ( neck stiffness , kernig 's sign , brudzinski 's sign ) . \n the patients with more than 1-week of symptoms initiation were evaluated ; in the other hand the patients were in the subacute phase . \n if there was no contraindication for performing a lumbar puncture ( lp ) , lp was done . \n patients with pleocytosis in the csf ( csf white blood cell > 5 ) entered the study ; also these patients were received no more than one dose of antibiotics . \n although in typical tb meningitis there is significant pleocytosis with lymphocyte predominance and high csf protein levels and significant decrease of csf glucose levels ( hypoglycorrhachia ) , but in the first 2 - 3 weeks of symptom initiation , typical csf pattern of tb meningitis may be absent . \n so not only typical or suggestive tb meningitis csf patterns entered , but also patients with normal or mildly increased levels of csf protein , normal or mildly decreased csf glucose levels , neutrophil predominance were entered the study . in the other hand , \n patients with mass - like lesion in imaging , brain abscess , hiv positive , posttraumatic , abrupt onset of symptoms , postsurgery and children were excluded . \n was obtained from the patient or a close relative for those who are unstable or unconscious at the time of presentation . required information including age , gender , main complaint , other symptoms of the disease , duration of the symptoms onset before hospitalization , records of close contact , \n patients underwent a detailed workup for meningitis including blood investigations , imaging ( chest x - ray , computed tomography [ ct ] scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging as and when indicated ) . following a lumbar puncture with standard and sterile method , \n about 10 ml csf was obtained , transported to the laboratory within 1 h , and divided into two tubes : 1 ( 1 - 2 ml ) for csf cells , protein and glucose , bacterial smear and culture and 1 ( 8 - 10 ml ) for tb pcr testing . \n dna was purified from 200 l of centrifuged deposit of csf sample using dna extraction kit ( roche , germany ) with standard dna extraction protocol . \n three sets of primers targeting different regions of the mycobacterium tuberculosis genome were : primer 1(5-ggctgtgggtagcagacc-3 ) , primer 2(5-cgggtccagatggcttgc-3 ) , probe(5-fam - tgtcgacctgggcagggttcg - tamra-3 ) . \n then pcr was performed in real time pcr ( qiagen - rotor gene - q ) system with the thermal cycling according to the following program : 95c for 6 min 1 time then ended by temperature cycling 95c for 15 s and 58c for 20 s and 72c for 10 s in 40 times . in each run \n all statistical analyses were performed by student 's t - test and fisher 's test . \n patients were mostly male ( 69.8% ) , with a mean age of 43.69  22.67 years . \n no statistically significant difference was detected between age of men and women by student 's t - test ( p = 0.2 ) . in figure 1 , \n the most common age group of patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of meningitis was 20 - 29 years ( 33 patients-20/4% ) . \n frequency of age group in this study cerebrospinal fluid reverse transcription - pcr results in 6 patients ( 3.7% ) were positive for tb dna . \n in other words , the frequency of positive tb dna was in male 5.3% and female 1.4% , respectively . according to fisher 's test , there was no significant difference between the sexes ( p = 0.99 ) [ table 1 ] . \n distribution of tb dna by sex the mean age of patients with tb pcr positive was 43.6  26.39 years , and tb pcr negative was 45.31  22.15 years . using t - test \n , no significant difference was observed between the two groups ( p = 0.87 ) . in figure 2 , \n , there were an estimated 8.8 million incident cases of tb ( range , 8.5 million-9.2 million ) in 2010 , 1.1 million deaths ( range , 0.9 million-1.2 million ) among hiv - negative cases of tb and an additional 0.35 million deaths ( range , 0.32 million-0.39 million ) among people who were hiv - positive . in the latest report , who determined 22 high tb burden countries ( hbcs ) that have been prioritized at a global level since 2000 . \n afghanistan and pakistan are in hbcs list , and we have a lot of immigrants from those countries repeatedly . the exact incidence and prevalence of tbm in the most parts of the world are not precisely known . \n some epidemiological details of extrapulmonary tb are available from developed countries . in developed countries , despite an overall decrease in numbers of tb cases , the proportion of extrapulmonary tb and tbm cases has increased . in 2005 in iran , \n the incidence rates of tb had been 25 - 49/100000 population . according to our study , \n no statistically significant difference was detected between age of men and women . in accordance with previous studies , age and sex \n , tbm is the most severe form and remains a major global health problem with a high mortality rate . although national public health services follow a rigorous tb surveillance and treatment regimen to improve the impact of the disease , a better diagnostic test remains to be developed for the prescribed treatment regimen to be followed effectively . \n though the detection of mycobacterium by microscopy and culture remains the criterion standard for tubercular diagnosis , poor sensitivity in detection of low microorganism densities in csf and mixed infections pose a significant challenge . \n in addition , the time required for lowenstein - jensen cultures is about 8 weeks , which makes it unsuitable as a routine technique for rapid confirmatory diagnosis . \n thus , diagnosis basically remains presumptive and is based on clinical symptoms , neurologic signs , csf findings , ct scans , and response to anti - tb drugs . \n the csf pcr assay represents a significant advance in the diagnosis of microbial diseases and tbm is no exception . \n the detection of mycobacterium tuberculosis dna in csf samples using pcr is widely used diagnostic method because of its speed . \n a proper selection of mycobacterium tuberculosis - specific dna and a caution against contamination of csf specimens are important for obtaining high specificity . \n entirely the most studies found low sensitivity for this test in tbm diagnosis ( about 50% ) however , the specificity was as high as 98% . \n the overall all of them believe in high specificity of pcr , so we designed this study to evaluate tb pcr positive rate in patients who present with fairly long symptoms of meningitis . \n other studies such as in thailand found that tbm was the second most important cause of chronic meningitis in their survey reflecting the importance of infectious diseases in tropical countries . in a series of 83 cases of chronic meningitis from new zealand , \n the most common diagnosed entity was tbm , which was found in 40% of the patients that is higher than our study finding . \n cases in our study were patients that their symptoms had not been started so acute or sudden , whereas they have investigated chronic meningitis that defines as suffering meningitis signs and symptoms for at least 4 weeks . \n tuberculous meningitis is both an insidious disease , and it can have an atypical clinical picture so that the onset of tbm may manifest as acute or subacute meningitis . \n identification of patients according to standard case definitions is important because early recognition and treatment of the disease is believed to be able to reduce the burden of this disease , lowering complication and mortality . \n first , due to budget limitations and few numbers of cases with lasting symptoms of meningitis , we could only select 162 samples . \n second , determining tb on acid fast bacilli ( afb ) staining smear needs a large amount of csf , but according to our patient 's conditions , it was impossible to provide large csf sample . third , as tb culture lasts 6 - 8 weeks to be positive and has low sensitivity , we did nt perform this test . further study with evaluating pcr , afb smear and tb culture with larger sample size may be needed . \n there are some important limitations to our study . first , due to budget limitations and few numbers of cases with lasting symptoms of meningitis , we could only select 162 samples . \n second , determining tb on acid fast bacilli ( afb ) staining smear needs a large amount of csf , but according to our patient 's conditions , it was impossible to provide large csf sample . third , as tb culture lasts 6 -

ross ihaka and robert gentleman , open source ) and openbugs ( v3.2.3 ; openbugs foundation ) . \n because trough fev1 was the primary efficacy outcome of the majority of the rcts , sensitivity analyses were conducted for the fev1 12- and 24-week outcomes to test the robustness of the nma results . specifically , because concomitant medications and copd severity are potential treatment effect modifiers , the sensitivity analyses included : 1 ) a subset of trials with no concomitant lama usage ( all trials which permitted concomitant usage were excluded ) ; 2 ) a meta - regression adjusting for disease severity ( adjusting for the percent of patients with severe / very severe copd ) ; and 3 ) a meta - regression adjusting for inhaled corticosteroid ( ics ) use ( adjusting for the percent of patients with ics use within each trial ) . \n the updated systematic review identified 916,17,2022,2730 full - text articles detailing 12 rcts that met the inclusion criteria ( figure 1 ) . \n these were pooled with 21 laba monotherapy rcts identified in the previous search,15,18,19,3148 resulting in a total of 33 rcts included in the nma . \n a list of included studies and details of the systematic literature search can be found in figure 1 , and the details of each study s own inclusion criteria are listed in table s1 . \n all studies were double - blind , multicenter rcts ( figure 2 ) , ranging from 12 weeks to 3 years in duration . \n all studies were placebo controlled , with the exception of one head - to - head study which compared the efficacy of indacaterol 150 g od to salmeterol 50 g bid.19 the studies were predominantly conducted in multiple countries simultaneously , although four were limited to the usa32,35,36,44 and one was limited to the netherlands.40 the majority of the studies were conducted in patients over the age of 40 with a smoking history of 10 pack - years and predicted fev1 of 80% . \n each trial predominantly enrolled male patients , and the mean age was > 60 years in all trials . \n the percentage of ics use , current smokers , and patients with severe or very severe copd varied among studies . \n the 33 rcts were synthesized in the nma ;

however , the validity of using these thresholds for post hoc active - arm comparisons has not been empirically evaluated . \n thus , nmas such as the current analysis are useful for comparing active treatments by testing for statistically significant differences between treatment outcomes after showing clinically meaningful efficacy against placebo . \n future prospective studies evaluating the thresholds for clinically meaningful differences between active treatments in copd therapy trials are needed . \n the results of this study add to and update the pre - existing literature on the comparative efficacy of labas in the treatment of copd , while coming to similar conclusions as previous studies about the efficacy of indacaterol . \n for example , a 2013 nma on the comparative efficacy of long - acting bronchodilators for copd found that indacaterol was associated with higher trough fev1 and superior improvement in sgrq score over comparative labas.23 in addition , a 2012 comparative effectiveness study evaluated indacaterol for copd versus placebo , formoterol , and salmeterol in rcts using the outcomes trough fev1 , sgrq , and tdi total scores . \n it found that indacaterol was as good as or superior to these bronchodilators in all the outcomes measured , and that indacaterol 300 g resulted in the best overall efficacy.50 a 2014 systematic review compared efficacy outcomes ( fev1 , sgrq and tdi scores , exacerbations , and use of rescue medication at 12 weeks ) for olodaterol and indacaterol and determined that these drugs had similar efficacy.24 however , a comment published later in 2014 noted that the study suffered from several limitations including a restricted search date resulting in exclusion of relevant clinical trials , study design heterogeneity , and reliance on data from other nmas rather than primary data within rcts.51 in the current analysis , only trials of the inhalation powder form of formoterol were included , in order to maintain consistency with the delivery device of the other comparators . \n however , nebulized formoterol may be beneficial for patients who are unable to use inhalation powder for reasons including frailty , arthritis , visual impairment , compromised mental capacity , exacerbation , difficulty using an inhaler , or inadequate hand / breath coordination . \n important differences may exist between real - world practice and clinical trial populations , such as training for the use of inhalers , adherence to treatment , and routine medical care , all of which may limit the applicability of the current results . some limitations inherent to nmas apply to the results of this study . \n for example , although the trials included in the nma were of good caliber , the validity of the current findings depends on the quality , biases , and study and patient characteristic reporting consistency of the included rcts . \n some variation existed in their inclusion criteria regarding the concomitant use of laba and icss , smoking history , age , the severity of copd , and exacerbation history . \n though sensitivity analyses have been conducted for our main outcome fev1 , meta - regression analyses of study - level data can be prone to ecological bias ( ie , the association between the study - level effect patient characteristics and treatment effects may not reflect the individual - level effect modification of a covariate ) . \n since there was only a single head - to - head trial , the ability to check the consistency of the direct and indirect evidence was limited . \n however , in this head - to - head trial , indacaterol 150 g was associated with a 0.06 l higher fev1 compared to salmeterol 50 g,19 which is consistent with the 0.057 l estimated in this analysis . \n in addition , other outcomes , which are important in the measurement of copd treatment efficacy and safety and played an essential role in treatment decisions , such as the use of rescue treatments and the severity of exacerbations , were not assessed in this study . \n future studies are warranted to further evaluate these outcomes among different treatment options for copd patients . \n lastly , exacerbations were expected to be defined differently among the included studies , and the nma results might be subject to those inconsistencies , if any . \n because the number of studies that contained that study outcome ( exacerbations ) was small , no subgroup analysis was conducted in this study . \n future research may be needed to conduct subgroup analysis among studies with consistent criteria and definitions , when there are sufficient studies . \n in conclusion , indacaterol 300 g od , followed by 150 g od , and 75 g od , were the most effective laba monotherapies for copd in terms of trough fev1 and tdi focal scores .", 11022, 493, "arxiv"], [158, "you want to get a job as a data analytist.

aged children spend much of their day at school , teacher for them \n is like a mother who helps them grow and learn . on the other hand , \n school is a significant part of every child 's life and children who suffer hospitalizations may miss long periods of these typical school experiences . \n for this reason , the major concern for mothers and children of school age is the damage to the educational process of the hospitalized child . \n however , participating in the familiar and normal activities such as hospital school program provides education and interaction for children with a sense of normalcy , reduces the stress of hospitalization , and helps the child cope . \n in addition , this program supports parents , especially mothers , in directing the educational program and accessing appropriate services for their children , with the hospital teacher helping in the transition from hospital to school as smooth as possible for the hospitalized child . \n studies suggest the presence of a child in a hospital classroom , or a school teacher at a child 's bedside , or even if the teacher is not available , following the education of child through his / her mother or the nurse , in order to effectively reduce their anxiety . this study is aimed to determine the effects of teachers presence at children 's bedside on the anxiety of mothers with hospitalized children . \n this randomized clinical trial was performed in mashhad , iran , from april to june 2010 . \n the population of the study included all mothers of hospitalized children of age 6 - 12 years who were admitted to pediatric wards of imam reza hospital . \n the study participants included mothers with children who had been experiencing more than 3 days of hospitalization , who were alert and had no severe pain , had appropriate general condition and received no narcotic medications , and suffered no mental problems . \n the purpose of the study was explained to the participants and their informed consents were obtained . \n the exclusion criteria included mothers with children who became unwell , experienced less than 2 days of hospitalization , who were transferred , and not cooperative . \n the criteria for selection of teachers were as follows : the teachers had to be female , with a university degree in pedagogy and a minimum of 5 years experience . \n after the completion of sampling in the intervention group , sampling was performed in the control group . in order to evaluate anxiety in mothers , we used spielberger state - trait anxiety inventory ( stai ) with 40 items . stai consists of two subcategories :  state anxiety  which measures an individual 's state of anxiety at a particular moment and  trait anxiety  which measures an individual 's personality trait of anxiety . \n each subcategory comprises 20 items , and each item is scored ranging from 1 to 4 ( from 1 = not at all to 4 = very much ) . \n the range of each subscale score is 2080 , with a higher score indicating greater anxiety . \n a score of 2139 indicates mild anxiety , 4059 indicates moderate anxiety , and a score of 6080 indicates severe anxiety . \n its reliability had already been confirmed on 600 people in mashhad , and the cronbach 's alpha coefficient obtained was 0.94 in the normal population . \n demographic data such as age , education level , occupation of mother , and the type of the child 's disease were also collected for each mother and child . \n the selected teacher who was qualified in 5 grade pedagogy with 15 years of experience and was approved by the department of education participated in the education of children every morning at 812 am . for children who were newly admitted , \n a review of previous lessons was done , and then , new lessons were offered . each day , \n new courses were offered in coordination with school curricula and the parents . at the time of admission , \n the child 's parents were asked to prepare textbooks . in order to allocate enough time to teach each child , \n the following were managed in advance : the hospital staff , rest time , visiting , and other applications were scheduled in such a way that they did not interfere with the teacher 's work . \n all statistical analyses were performed at a confidence level of 0.05 using spss 11.5 ( ibm software version 11.5 . \n in addition , paired t - tests were used to compare the scores before and after the intervention ; t - test was used to compare the anxiety scores of the groups . \n the study was approved by the ethics committee of mashhad university of medical sciences and was registered in iranian center of clinical trial registration with the i d number of irct2014122820453n1 . \n the study was approved by the ethics committee of mashhad university of medical sciences and was registered in iranian center of clinical trial registration with the i d number of irct2014122820453n1 . \n a total of 63 mothers with hospitalized children were screened during the study period . of these \n , nine mothers did not meet the inclusion criteria and four mothers declined to participate in the study . \n the remaining 50 mothers were randomly allocated to two groups and completed the present study [ figure 1 ] . \n smirnov test showed that the distribution of data was normal and there was no statistically significant difference between the intervention and control groups , in terms of individual characteristics and demographic variables . \n the mean value of mothers age was 31  7.1 years , 60% of whom were householders and 42% had high school education . \n demographic characteristics of the mothers with hospitalized children ( n=50 ) the results showed that before intervention , the means and standard deviations of mothers trait anxiety scores in the experimental and control groups were not significantly different ( p = 0.164 ) . \n however , after intervention , the mothers mean trait anxiety scores decreased significantly in the experimental group compared to the control group ( p < 0.001 ) . also , in the intervention group , the mothers mean trait anxiety scores significantly decreased , compared to the scores in the pre - intervention phase ( p < 0.001 ) . the mean scores of mothers state anxiety in both groups before and after treatment showed no significant difference [ table 2 ] . \n comparison of the mean and standard deviation of mothers trait and state anxiety scores in the experimental and control groups \n the major finding of the present study was that the teacher 's presence at the children 's bedside led to a significant reduction of anxiety in mothers of hospitalized children . \n since education is a part of the normal development of a child , it seems that the teacher 's presence and the hospitalized child 's return to his / her normal activities before hospitalization ( reviewing and learning lessons ) can be among the measures that cause easier compliance with the unfamiliar environment of the hospital for the child and his / her mother and , consequently , reduce their anxiety . \n the american academy of pediatrics , in explaining the policy of child life services for hospitalized children , recommended cooperating and coordinating with the school for training ill children in the hospital and at home , and considering the teacher of the child as part of this plan . \n for this reason , across the world , many hospitals , especially pediatric hospitals in philadelphia , boston , and san francisco , have implemented programs like hospital school program , in order to provide mental , emotional , and spiritual support to children , mothers , and families . in a study that reviews the emotional problems and education of hospitalized children \n , it was concluded that for most children who are hospitalized and are in the educable age , their education should not be forgotten in the hospital , because education is part of the normal development of a child . \n due to the importance of education for children admitted in hospital , in another study , it was reported that since the major concern of most school - age children and their mothers is about educational status , it seems logical that children can attend the hospital school or have bedside teaching . \n if teachers are not available , the mother or nurse may be able to follow the school assignment and monitor that the lessons are studied . in a study that surveyed the educational services for hospitalized children , in an attempt to accommodate the educational needs of children in hospitals , some pediatric hospitals in canada had teachers who provided one - on - one teaching either in a hospital classroom or at the bedside of children who were hospitalized for extended periods . \n this study concluded that the involvement of a teacher in a patient 's total care enhances the student 's learning potential while being ill and facilitates a smoother return to school . \n however , in these studies , there are many challenges in teaching hospitalized children . for example , education in the early days of hospitalization is a difficult issue because a defiant or sulky child will block any effort of the teacher to help him / her ; interaction with these children is difficult and it requires patience and initiative . on the other hand , motivation for \n learning should be strong enough in such a way that a warm , sympathetic , and understanding teacher brings the child to accept education in the hospital schoolroom or at the bedside , while in all other activities , he / she may be a rebellious or passive . the teacher can establish a good relationship with a child in the somewhat neutral surroundings of books , pencils , and papers , while the nurse or physician may not be able to get close to the child . \n one of the limitations of this study was the less number of participants in each group . \n therefore , it is recommended to conduct further studies with larger sample sizes , which would be useful for confirming the results of this study . \n this may be affected by social desirability ; thus , the use of objective measurements is recommended in future studies . \n one of the limitations of this study was the less number of participants in each group . \n therefore , it is recommended to conduct further studies with larger sample sizes , which would be useful for confirming the results of this study . \n this may be affected by social desirability ; thus , the use of objective measurements is recommended in future studies . \n  \n ", 2519, 314, "arxiv"], [162, "Propose a hypothesis based on the survey data.\n\nSurvey result reveals that people who have direct contact with animals are more creative than those who don\u2019t.", 30, 13, "alpaca"], [163, "Create a dialogue that illustrates a disagreement between two characters.", 11, 123, "alpaca"], [164, "Please help me complete the long-text summarization task, where the long text is 'input' and the summarized result is 'output'.\n\nthe input is: nitric oxide ( no ) , a free radical with moderate reactivity , has emerged as an important signaling molecule in a multitude of physiological systems in the human body . in the gastrointestinal tract , \n no is involved in the regulation of regional blood flow , smooth muscle relaxation , secretory and immunological regulation . during inflammation the production of no \n rectal no concentrations in healthy volunteers ( range 325 ppbv ) are significantly lower than the concentrations in patients with active inflammatory bowel disease ( ibd ) ( range 718978 ppbv )     . \n no can be synthesized in eukaryotic cells through oxidation of l -

state conditions , the no concentrations range between 14 and 900 ng \n . another no producing mechanism is by the reduction of nitrite . for lactobacilli   and bifidobacteria \n hence , acidic nonenzymatic reduction of nitrite was suggested as the predominant pathway for no production in vitro by lactic acid producing bacteria ( lactobacilli   and   bifidobacteria ) as the produced organic acids decrease the ph of the agar plates to 4     . whereas no production by lactic acid bacteria was considered to be chemical , no production from nitrite by escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium was shown to be biological . \n the enzymes responsible for the no formation from nitrite in e. coli and s. typhimurium are periplasmic and cytoplasmic nitrite reductase and nitrate reductase , respectively     [ 23 , 24 ] . \n to date , the relevance and mechanism of bacterial no production under gastrointestinal conditions remain elusive . with no being produced by inducible nos in epithelial cells as a response to cytokines and bacterial products , it is of interest to know whether bacterial no production can occur under gastrointestinal conditions . \n the objective of our study was to unravel the mechanisms by which human fecal microbiota are able to produce no in vitro . \n three possible pathways were considered ( i ) l -

n / l medium in all experiments ( figure 2(a ) ) . \n a proportional effect was observed for n2o production and the amount of supplied nitrate ( figure 2(b ) ) . \n however , addition of 5 and 50 mg no3-n / l resulted in significant n2o production . to examine whether microbiological production of no and n2o was possible under gastrointestinal conditions , fecal microbiota were grown in the presence of a complex medium simulating the conditions in the colon ( figure 1 ) . \n the feed medium was analyzed for nitrate and a background of 0.11 mg no3-n / l was measured . \n after 24 hours of incubation , the ph dropped to 4.13  0.05 , 4.24  0.03 and 4.47  0.03 for 0.11 , 5 and 50 mg no3-n / l , respectively . \n nitrite at time 0 was below 0.1 mg no2-n / l but after 24 hours concentrations of 0.1  0.1 and 2.0  0.2 mg no2-n / l were detected for 5 and 50 mg no3-n / l , respectively . \n figures 2(c ) and 2(d ) show the concentrations of no and n2o measured after 24 hours . the no concentration measured in the medium without nitrate addition was 37.0  0.3 ng no - n / l . \n the addition of 5 mg no3-n / l increased the no concentration slightly to 44.1  2.5 ng no - n / l medium . \n however the addition of 50 mg / l no3-n increased the no concentration drastically to 298  33 g no - n / l medium . as for the mineral media , a positive effect for the n2o production with the supplemented nitrate was observed . \n the same experimental setup as described above was used but under buffered conditions ( measured ph was always between 6 and 6.8 ) , thus avoiding fermentative acidification during biotic incubations . \n as shown in figures 2(e ) and 2(f ) , the no concentrations increased slightly when nitrate was added . \n the concentration of n2o in buffered feed medium supplemented with 5 mg no3-n / l was comparable to the concentration measured in the nonbuffered test reported above . for the highest concentration of nitrate a lower n2o concentration was detected compared to the nonbuffered test ( figure 2 ) . \n a n tracer study was used to link nitrate consumption to denitrification or dnra by the fecal microbiota under gastrointestinal conditions . \n the setup was the same as for the buffered feed medium but kno3 ( 10 atom % ) was used as n - source in 2 different concentrations , that is , 5 and 50 mg no3-n / l ( figure 1 ) . \n table 1 gives an overview of the nitrogen concentrations measured and the recovery of n after 24 hours of anaerobic incubation . \n the amount of no and n2o produced per volume of feed medium was in the same range as what was found in the buffered feed medium experiment ( table 1 ) . \n after 24 hours , concentrations reached 182  4 , 210  1 , 275  6 ,   and 50.1  2.6 mg \n no3-n / l , and the chemical control , respectively . to verify if no can be produced as a side product or as an intermediate during dnra , e. coli lmg 18221 , a strain capable of dnra but not denitrification \n after 24 hours , no concentrations of 170 ng no - n / l medium were measured . \n this no concentration was twice as high compared to no concentrations produced by the fecal cultures . \n figure 3(a ) shows that diluting the fecal suspension 200 times before inoculation in buffered feed medium results in a 75% increase in the no concentration . \n there was a difference in the no concentration related to the fecal suspension and optimal dilution . \n the optimal dilution ranged between 1/20 and 1/200 and the increase of no between 50 and 75% , respectively . \n the addition of supernatant from a fecal suspension resulted in a decrease of the no concentration ( figure 3(b ) ) . \n a continuous model that simulates the gastrointestinal tract ( shime ) was used to measure no production by human gastrointestinal microbiota . \n the no concentrations in the headspace of the 3 colon vessels were analyzed after an incubation period of 24 hours . in the colon ascendens , 101 ng \n no - n / l shime suspension was measured but lower concentrations were found in the colon transversum and descendens ( 5.4 and 8.5 ng no - n / l shime suspension , respectively ) . \n a batch setup was performed to test whether this difference was due to ( i ) the microbial community or ( ii ) the availability of nutrients in the different colon compartments . \n the biomass of the different colon compartments was washed and grown anaerobically in fresh feed medium for 24 hours . as references \n , the microbial suspensions of the different colon vessels were incubated in parallel in penicillin bottles with or without the addition of fresh feed . to exclude a chemical process , \n cell - free supernatant of the shime suspension was filtersterilized or autoclaved and subsequently incubated . \n figure 4 shows that the addition of feed increases the no concentrations at least 3 times but the difference between the first colon vessel and the other 2 was maintained . \n incubation of the washed biomass showed that even higher concentrations of no were produced ( ranging between 220 and 250 ng no - n / l ) and that the supernatant that was removed might have an inhibitory effect on the no production as observed above . \n no chemical production of no was seen when the cell - free supernatant of the shime suspension was incubated . \n our results demonstrate that the fecal microbiota of healthy persons are able to produce no in concentrations up to 90 ng no - n / l medium when grown in conditions simulating the colon ( figure 2(e ) ) . adding l - arginine to the feed medium inoculated with fecal microbiota of a healthy person had no effect on the no production . \n high amounts of nitrate in combination with low ph resulted in substantial no and n2o production ( figures 2(c ) and 2(d ) ) . \n however , no and n2o were also formed under ph buffered conditions ( figures 2(e ) and 2(f ) ) . \n these data corroborate the metabolic capacity of the fecal microbiota to reduce nitrate and produce no . by using n tracer experiments \n , it was shown that nitrate was mainly reduced to ammonium by dnra suggesting that no was produced as a side product or intermediate of this pathway . \n no was detected not only in the batch tests but also in the in vitro shime model . \n indirect evidence from in vitro studies demonstrates that extracellular l - arginine increases the no production by euknos ( at concentrations at which the enzyme should be saturated ) , known as the  l - arginine paradox      [ 37 , 38 ] and some prokaryotic nos proteins have been shown to produce no in vivo     [ 1417 ] . \n the reaction from l - arginine to no is oxygen dependent what might explain why l - arginine has no increasing effect during anaerobic growth of the fecal microbiota . \n therefore , we consider the arginine pathway for bacterial no production under gastrointestinal conditions as not important . in the lower parts of the gastrointestinal tract , nitrate originates from dietary products rich in nitrate , like spinach , beetroot , or fennel or simply from minor levels as present in drinking water . \n nitrate is reduced by the bacteria in the oral cavity or is absorbed in the small intestine . in healthy persons , levels in the order of mg no3-n / l can be estimated in the large intestine   and feces were shown to contain around 0.15 mg no3-n / l     . \n based on these data , 2 different concentrations of nitrate ( 5 and 50 mg no3-n \n very low concentrations of nitrate were measured in the feed medium receiving no additional nitrate ( 110 \n 50 g   no3-n / l ) , representative for the concentrations found in feces . \n no3-n / l very high concentrations of no ( 29.8 g no - n / l ) were measured . during the incubations , the ph dropped to a mean value of 4.24 due to the accumulation of organic acids produced by the microorganisms . at these low ph values , a chemical reduction of nitrite to no ( ph below 5.5 ) can not be excluded     . in vivo , \n the ph increases over the different colon parts . considering a ph of 6.37  0.58 in the colon ascendens , 6.61  0.83 in the colon transversum and 7.04  0.67 in the colon descendens , \n a chemical reduction of nitrite to no in vivo is not likely . because it was unclear whether no was produced chemically or biologically \n the very high no concentrations produced at low ph in feed medium containing the highest nitrate concentration   were not found at neutral ph . in a study of sobko \n the production of no by fecal microbiota cultivated on iso - sensitest agar supplemented with nitrate was demonstrated . for the plates supplemented with 1.4 mg \n no3-n / l , concentrations in the range 293600 ppbv no , corresponding to 1145 ng no - n / l in the microbial suspension , were measured but a high variability was seen between different fecal samples . as the ph of the plates decreased from 7 to 5 , a chemical reduction could not be excluded . \n however , it was concluded that the fecal no generation was not solely due to acidification of the plates     . \n we can conclude that the no concentrations found in our study , which were between 90 and 100 ng no / l for low concentrations of nitrate , are in the same order of magnitude . under anaerobic conditions \n , bacteria can use nitrate as n - source in nitrate assimilation and 2 dissimilatory processes , denitrification and dnra . \n denitrification is assumed to be the major nitrate removal pathway in many anoxic ecosystems like soils , sediments , and water treatment plants   but information about the occurrence of this process in the human colon is limited . \n denitrifying bacteria are found in alpha- , beta , gamma- and epsilonproteobacteria , firmicutes , and bacteroidetes . during denitrification no is produced in the nanomolar range , without reaching toxic levels     [ 21 , 22 ] . \n when the supply of electron acceptor is limited , it is more beneficial for the bacteria to exploit dnra rather than denitrification because of the higher electron consumption . \n molecular and biochemical studies have described dnra in some enteric bacteria      but information about the occurrence of this process in complex microbial cultures including the microbiota of the human gastrointestinal tract is limited . \n allison and macfarlane   reported that dnra is the major pathway for nitrate reduction by the fecal microbiota . \n identification based on phenotype and genotype showed that clostridium ramosum , bacteroides vulgates , and the enterobacteriaceae were mainly capable of dnra . \n these species are representative for the dominant groups of the fecal microbiota     [ 31 , 32 ] . by adding the stable isotope \n n in the form of nitrate , the occurrence of all nitrate - reducing processes under gastrointestinal conditions was studied and quantified . \n high ammonium concentrations in the medium repress nitrate assimilation and enhance the use of nitrate for the dissimilatory processes . under gastrointestinal conditions \n nitrate seems to be completely reduced to ammonium and not to n2 gas and during this reductive process , no is produced in low concentrations . to our knowledge , \n further proof for no production during dnra was given by e. coli   k12 , a strain capable of dnra but not denitrification ( data not shown ) . \n this strain produced 170 ng no - n / l under gastrointestinal conditions with low concentrations of nitrate ( 110 g   no3-n / l ) . \n evidence for no as an intermediate in dnra would be even more decisive when n - no was measured during the n tracer study . \n however , equipment for n - no analyses is very specialized      and not in the scope of this paper . whether n2o is an intermediate as well or \n the reduction product of a defense mechanism of bacteria to no   is not clear . \n the gaseous no concentration measured in the colon ascendens ( ca ) vessel of the in vitro shime model was around 15 times higher than the no concentrations measured in the colon transversum ( ct ) and colon descendens ( cd ) . during \n the batch experiments incubation of the microbial suspension from the different colon vessels showed that the no concentration of the ca doubled when adding fresh medium . \n the addition of fresh feed medium decreased the difference in no concentrations between the colon vessels . remarkably , \n when removing the supernatant of the suspension , a 6-fold increase of no was seen and the difference between the colon vessels disappeared , indicating that the availability of nutrients rather than a difference in the microbial community was responsible for the differences between the colon vessels . \n also , a similar inhibitory effect was seen by adding the supernatant of the fecal suspension to the inoculated buffered feed medium . diluting the fecal suspension to increase \n no production confirmed our observation . a possible explanation for this inhibitory effect can be the presence of bile salts . about 5% of the bile salts secreted in the duodenum is available to the microbiota in the colon . to protect them , \n the microbiota tend to hydrolyze the bile salts but around 5% of the nonconverted bile salts can be found in human feces and will have toxic effects on the bacteria     . \n diluting the fecal suspension could decrease the toxic effect and thus increase the bacterial metabolism . \n the same explanation might be valid for the lower no concentrations in the nonbuffered compared to the buffered feed medium for the 2 lower concentrations of nitrate . as the ph drops during the nonbuffered incubations , \n the metabolism of the bacteria might be suppressed leading to a lower formation of no . \n epithelial cells are known to produce no through oxidation of l - arginine by nos     [ 4 , 5 ] . \n although bacterial origin was considered , the no was believed to originate from the mucosa . \n several years later , no concentrations were measured in the rectum that was not cleared from luminal bacteria and again no concentrations in patients with active ibd were elevated . \n our results corroborate that the fecal microbiota actively produce substantial levels of no , even from traces of nitrate . in vitro the fecal microbiota \n no no was found in the rectum of healthy volunteers but 40 ng no - n / l was measured in the rectum of patients with active ibd     . \n externally added no ( in the form of gas or no donor ) has been shown to alter the mucosal barrier function     [ 4749 ] and to have an effect on the metabolism of colonocytes . as it was strongly suggested that several constitutive and/or inducible defense systems exist in mammalian cells that neutralize the damaging effects of no \n , the high rectal levels of no in ibd patients and the low levels in healthy persons might indicate that the expression of these defense mechanisms in ibd patients is ineffective . in this work , \n the human fecal microbiota were shown to produce no from trace levels of nitrate under gastrointestinal conditions . moreover , our data indicate that no was produced by dnra and not by denitrification or the l - arginine pathway . \n studying the interaction between bacterially produced no and the host epithelial cells might be pivotal in the etiology of inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract .", 6977, 222, "arxiv"], [165, "Aaron has four times as many cows as does Matthews.

term influence on subsequent ecosystem processes . \n the role of suspended or arboreal litter in ecosystem processes has not been well - studied , and the literature is comprised of eclectic publications . \n some species have been shown to self - retain dead leaves and branches , and other understory species have been shown to intercept a disproportionately high amount of falling litter . \n general quantity and traits of arboreal litter indicate the canopy location of suspended litter can be ephemeral as wind and branch movement repeatedly dislodge the litter , and decomposition of suspended litter that is artificially tethered in place is slow compared with litter on soil surfaces \n . the composition and abundance of arthropods in arboreal litter may be highly contrasting to that of litter deposited on the forest floor . \n availability of arboreal litter is critically important for these specialist arthropods and insectivorous bird species that specialize on dead - leaf inhabiting arthropods . \n the dead leaflet material that was generated by the passage of typhoon haiyan ( fig . \n 1 ) may influence biogeochemical processes in a manner that is distinct from any previously published information concerning arboreal litter . \n ( 1 ) the petiole , rachis , and many leaflets of the leaves on these damaged palm and cycad trees remained green and will likely retain the leaves on the trees for extended periods . \n the dead sections of these large leaves were not detached , they remained affixed to live leaves . therefore , \n the routine dislodging by wind and branch movements that is characteristic of suspended , arboreal litter will not occur and the dead material will remain in place for extended periods of time . \n ( 2 ) initial quality of this form of litter will be greater than the other forms of suspended litter that are generated by interception of naturally abscised leaves . \n the leaf sections killed by the forces of typhoon haiyan did not proceed through the typical resorption of nutrients associated with natural organ senescence . \n ( 3 ) this dead leaflet material will be more exposed to solar radiation than forest floor litter or suspended abscised litter that is intercepted by the sub - canopy . as a result \n , the abiotic catabolism imposed by photooxidation of this unique form of canopy litter will exceed that of other forms of litter . \n ( 4 ) leaching of soluble materials will be greater in this typhoon - generated litter than in other forms of litter because precipitation is initially intercepted by the upper canopy and the dead material will remain exposed to leaching processes for much greater lengths of time than suspended detached litter or ground litter . \n when the dead leaflet material is ultimately detached , its quality will be disparate from that of other forms of litter due to preferential long - term leaching of soluble materials like potassium , phosphorus , sugars , and phenolics . \n ( 5 ) the proportion of decay attributed to catabolism of organic molecules by saprophytic organisms will be minimal in this form of litter , as the dry canopy environment is not conducive to mineralization by fungi and bacteria . \n ( 6 ) in contrast , the proportion of decay attributed to comminution by detritivorous insects and mites will be greater than in other forms of litter due to a greater length of time that these detritivores can feed on the dead materials . \n we believe this form of damage by tropical cyclones is commonplace , but has gone unnoticed until now \n . its prevalence will be greater in regions like the philippines where a high proportion of the forest communities are comprised of arecaceae , cycadaceae , pandanaceae , and other families that contain species with large , tough leaves that are resistant to wind damage . based on our field work , \n typhoon haiyan exerted direct damage in habitats containing five cycadaceae species and 70 species and infraspecific taxa of arecaceae . \n future studies including this unique form of arboreal litter created by tropical cyclones would be of use for increasing our understanding of the mechanisms by which large scale disturbances influence biogeochemical processes .", 1494, 180, "arxiv"], [169, "Could you format English-language copy?", 7, 127, "sharegpt"], [170, "Explain why the death penalty should be abolished.", 10, 66, "alpaca"], [171, "Describe the process of natural selection in 1-2 sentences.", 13, 31, "alpaca"], [172, "Uncle Bradley has a $1000 bill that he wants to change into smaller bills so he could give them to his nieces and nephews.

threatening emergency facing clinicians with an overall annual incidence of approximately 100 hospital admissions per 100,000 population . \n peptic ulcer bleeding is a common medical emergency accounting for 50%70% of cases of acute nonvariceal ugib and is significantly associated with morbidity , mortality , and health costs . \n initial hemostatic rates of 80% to 95% can be achieved with effective endoscopic therapies such as local injection , contact thermal coagulation , and hemoclips . despite remarkable advances in diagnosis and treatment of peptic ulcer bleeding , bleeding recurs in 10%30% of patients . \n therefore , recurrence of bleeding after initial endoscopic hemostasis has been described as the single most adverse independent prognostic factor for this group of patients . \n endoscopic hemostasis including mechanical , thermal , and by injection of various agents , whether epinephrine , distilled water , cyanoacrylate , ethanol , or polidocanol , has been found to decrease the risk of rebleeding , need for surgery , and the mortality . \n although vigorous efforts have been made to delineate the ideal endoscopic method for achieving hemostasis , there is still a great deal of uncertainty about a highly effective and simple hemostatic technique to reduce the risk of rebleeding in patients with nonvariceal ugib . \n endoscopic injection of dilute epinephrine is considered a highly effective and popular endoscopic scheme for ugib , owing to its low cost , wide availability , lack of severe local or systemic injury , and easy to administer . however \n , epinephrine injection may induce cardiovascular complications and mild histologic changes such as hematoma and perforation . because mechanical and chemical effects of epinephrine are short - lived \n , the addition of a second agent , such as polidocanol or ethanol , may be beneficial for preventing recurrent bleeding by prolonging hemostatic mechanisms of epinephrine . \n therefore , wide variation in the rate of rebleeding can be explained by difference in the mechanisms of the action of the injected agents and differences in injection volume . \n however , clinical trials in patients with bleeding ulcers disclosed that no single solution is superior to another for hemostasis . \n furthermore , results from several studies have revealed that injection of normal saline solution or distilled water has a primary role in hemostasis similar to those of epinephrine in the endoscopic therapy of patients with bleeding ulcers . in this regard , there has been no clinical study that evaluates the effects of fresh frozen plasma ( ffp ) in the endoscopic therapy of patients with ugib . \n ffp , the most commonly prescribed hemostatic agent , is prepared either from a single whole blood donation or obtained by apheresis , frozen within a specific period and stored at a proper temperature up to 1 year that will maintain all of the coagulation factors , electrolytes , and plasma proteins . \n it has been shown that ffp is a good source of coagulation factors which can correct mild to moderate coagulopathy . \n therefore , if the injection of ffp has similar effects epinephrine , it might be an alternative solution for the treatment of patients with bleeding ulcers because of its low cost , wide availability , rapidity , ease of application , and lack of severe complication . \n this study was designed to shed light on the possible role of ffp as a hemostatic agent in patients with high - risk bleeding peptic ulcers . \n a prospective , randomized , single - blind , parallel group trial was conducted at al - zahra hospital from august 23 , 2015 , to april 21 , 2016 . \n all cases were informed about the procedure of the survey and written informed consent was obtained from all them . \n all patients with hematemesis , melena , or hematochezia underwent for emergency endoscopy within 24 h of admission . only men and women over 18 years of age with ulcers indicative of a high - risk for spontaneous recurrent bleeding including bleeding visible vessel ( spurting or oozing ) , adherent clot , and nonbleeding visible vessel were selected . \n patients were excluded from the study if they had another possible bleeding site or an acute significant illness , were pregnant , had a severe bleeding tendency , and unable , or unwilling to give written consent . \n after an explanation of the nature of the study and patient consultation with their gastroenterologist , informed written consents were attained from all patients . \n the ethical institutional committee of isfahan university of medical sciences approved the protocol of study . \n overall , a total of 100 patients with high - risk bleeding peptic ulcers were enrolled in the study , and completed interventions without interruption . \n after the enrollment , all patients were randomly divided into one of the two groups using random allocation method . \n patients were stratified according to their forrest classification and then randomized 1:1 into two intervention groups : group a who received injection of epinephrine diluted 1:20,000 in saline solution alone in volumes of 8 ml aliquots by multiple punctures into and around the bleeding point and group b who received injection of epinephrine diluted 1:20,000 in saline solution plus thawed ffp in volumes of 8 ml around the ulcer base and beneath the bleeding source . during the period of endoscopic treatment , \n , endoscopic biopsy specimens from the gastric antrum and one from the gastric body were obtained for a rapid urease test for helicobacter pylori . in our study , \n initial hemostasis was defined as endoscopically verified cessation of hemorrhage for at least 5 min after the first endoscopic treatment and maximal water irrigation for 10 s. recurrent bleeding was suspected clinically as one or more signs of ongoing or new bleeding , including vomiting of fresh blood , melena or bloody stool , instability of vital signs or hemodynamic , and a reduction of hemoglobin concentration by more than 20 \n patients with rebleeding were confirmed by endoscopy immediately and retreated with endoscopic treatments such as epinephrine injection plus argon plasma coagulation ( apc ) , transcatheter arterial embolization , and emergent surgery . \n after endoscopy treatment , all patients were closely monitored in an intensive care unit until the first follow - up and blood transfusion was given to maintain the hemoglobin level at > 10 \n the outcomes assessed in the study were the in - hospital recurrent bleeding , duration of hospitalization , surgery , and 30-day mortality . \n analysis of the current study was performed using the spss for hardware ( version 20.0 ; spss , chicago , il , usa ) . \n t - test , chi - square , and tests were applied to ensure homogeneity between the two groups in terms of age and gender . \n results of endpoints parameter at baseline and 24 h after treatment were compared between the two groups using paired student 's t - tests . for quantitative data , \n results of the analysis were summarized by mean  standard deviation or number ( percent ) . \n all tests were two - tailed , and p < 0.05 was considered as a significant . \n a total of 108 patients with ugib were recruited during the study period . of these , eight patients were excluded due to endoscopically uncontrollable bleeding , gastric malignancy , and multiple sites of bleeding at endoscopy . \n the two treatment groups well matched for demographic and clinical characteristics including age , gender , nsaid ingestion , comorbid disease , positive h. pylori , hemodynamic status at entrance , bleeding stigma , ulcer size , and transfusion requirements during the first 24 h [ table 1 ] . \n there were one hundred patients who were included in the study , fifty in each group . \n other clinical and endoscopic data for the patients at study entry are summarized in table 1 . \n initial hemostasis was achieved in 47 of 50 patients ( 94% ) in the group a and 49 of 50 patients ( 98% ) in the group b. clinical and endoscopic characteristics of the patients at study entry we found no statistically significant differences in the rate of initial hemostasis between group a and group b ( p = 0.61 ) . \n there were no significant differences in the rate of recurrent bleeding between group a ( 14% ) and group b ( 8% ) ( p = 0.52 ) . \n seven patients in group a had recurrent bleeding but were controlled in three patients with additional apc , and in three by surgical intervention . \n recurrent bleeding was also controlled in three patients of group b. recurrent bleeding was controlled in one patient by apc , and in two patients by surgical intervention . \n the endoscopic findings indicated that duodenal ulcer was the source of bleeding in 54 patients . \n there were no significant differences between two groups in terms of ulcer type , ulcer size , volume of epinephrine used during endoscopic hemostasis , and forrest class . \n major complications from endoscopic treatment including severe abdominal pain following hemostasis , perforation , and endoscopic therapy induced bleeding were observed more frequently in the group b than in the group a and the differences were not statistically significant . \n we did not find procedure - related cardiovascular or respiratory complication such as cardiac arrhythmia , considerable change in oxygen saturation , significant changes in systolic pressure , and abrupt change in pulse rates after endoscopic hemostasis in groups a and b. furthermore , there were no significant differences between group a and group b with respect to the surgery rate , bleeding death , procedure related death , and duration of hospitalization [ table 2 ] . \n bleeding peptic ulcer is a potentially life - threatening disease with a considerable mortality and morbidity . \n the effectiveness of endoscopic treatment for ugib is well established ; endoscopic therapy is commonly used as the first - line treatment in patients with nonvariceal upper gi , and epinephrine alone is among the most widely used injection solutions . in an effort for more effective hemostasis and to reduce the risk of rebleeding in patients with high - risk of ugib , a number of endoscopic treatment modalities are firmly established including injection , thermal , and mechanical . although the combination of epinephrine injection with a thermal method shows a consistent trend in favor of combined treatment , there is not yet strong evidence that any modality is superior to injection of epinephrine alone for treatment of patients with ugib . \n one of the reasons might be that combined therapy is not available in all hospitals , and it is more technically demanding . \n it has been shown that unsatisfactory visualization of the bleeding site , unsuccessful application of epinephrine injection , and recurrent bleeding in actively bleeding ulcers may be associated with the age , gender , comorbid disease , positive h. pylori , hemodynamic status at entrance , ulcer size , ulcer location , and transfusion requirements during the first 24 h , which were similar between two groups in our study , indicating that the outcomes of the study are unlikely influenced by these factors . \n a number of agents with different mechanisms of action such as vessel compression , vasoconstriction , and platelet aggregation have been investigated . \n therefore , the addition of ffp , the most commonly prescribed hemostatic agent , would be advantageous in theory . despite the theoretical advantages of ffp \n , previous studies revealed no significant differences between injection of epinephrine alone or in combination with other solutions such as distilled water and normal saline solution . \n although it is difficult to sort out these inconsistent outcomes of previous studies , the difference may in part be clarified by a small number of patients , different subtype of peptic ulcer bleeding , combined with the fact that epinephrine injection is adequate in most cases with acute ugib . \n these possible reasons are explained in previous meta - analyses that compared efficacy of injection of epinephrine alone with epinephrine and a second injected solution in the patients with peptic ulcer bleeding . \n meta - analysis of the recent controlled trials revealed that combined therapy seems to be more effective than epinephrine injection alone , but a particular form of treatment is not equal or superior to another . \n although the absolute improvement in the outcomes of our study is relatively small , we failed to detect a significant reduction in the need for surgery , overall rate of mortality , duration of hospitalization , and rate of rebleeding . in a similar study , \n 140 patients with ulcers and endoscopic features indicative of a high - risk for spontaneous recurrent bleeding were assigned to endoscopic injection with epinephrine ( group a ) and epinephrine plus human thrombin ( group b ) . \n they reported that endoscopic injection of epinephrine alone results in rebleeding rates of 20% , an overall mortality of 10% , and administration of 297 units of blood . \n the combination of endoscopic injection of epinephrine with an injection of human thrombin might be superior , resulting in rebleeding rates of 4.5% , an overall mortality of 0% , and administration of 219 units of blood . \n our findings are inconsistent with the results of their study that highlighting advantages of the combination of epinephrine plus a second solution \n . a possible explanation for the discrepancy may lie in the fact that high - dose continuous intravenous ppis greatly lowers the rate of rebleeding , resulting in the conflicting findings but can not serve as a specific explanation for the failure of ffp because the dose of ppis reported for both studies appears identical . in another study , \n 415 patients with high - risk bleeding ulcers were randomized to injection of epinephrine alone or epinephrine plus ethanolamine . \n they found no significant differences in the rate of mortality or in the proportions of the patients who required surgery . \n in addition , they showed a trend toward less recurrent bleeding after injection of the epinephrine plus ethanolamine . \n therefore , the findings of their study suggested that adding ethanolamine to epinephrine can effectively prevent recurrent bleeding and might be some of the value in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding . \n however , pescatore et al . found that injection of epinephrine alone and epinephrine plus fibrin glue does not have comparable recurrent bleeding rates , indicating that adding fibrin glue to epinephrine is not superior to epinephrine injection alone in the treatment of high - risk bleeding peptic ulcers . due to \n increasing number of reports describing differential and conflicting results , more extensive studies in larger groups of patients should be undertaken to analyze the putative role of adding a second agent to epinephrine for injection treatment of patients with high - risk bleeding ulcers . \n in summary , this single - center , prospective , randomized , controlled trial of patients with ugib has shown that injection of epinephrine alone was equally effective as injection of epinephrine plus ffp to endoscopic hemostasis . \n epinephrine alone and epinephrine plus ffp were not different in recurrent bleeding , surgery , blood transfusion , or mortality . financial support of isfahan university of medical sciences , isfahan ( research project number : 395100 ) . \n financial support of isfahan university of medical sciences , isfahan ( research project number : 395100 ) . \n  \n mkh contributed in the conception of the work , conducting the study , revising the draft , approval of the final version of the manuscript , agreed for all aspect of the work . \n mk contributed in the conception of the work , conducting the study , revising the draft , agreed for all aspects of work . \n ash contributed in the conception of the work , conducting the study , agreed for all aspects of the work . \n vs contributed in the conception of the work , revising the draft , agreed all aspects of the work .", 3382, 378, "arxiv"], [187, "Cody goes to the store and buys $40 worth of stuff.

incisors . \n this modification was considered appropriate because of the marked difference in diameter between the canals of bovine and human teeth . \n in addition , studies with human dentin blocks would definitely be more suitable to simulate the clinical scenario . \n the presence of the cementum affected the ability of the e.faecalis cells to infect the dentinal tubules , therefore , the cementum was removed from the specimens and a period of 21 days for microbial inoculation was taken for this study . \n the effective antimicrobial action of the tested intracanal medicaments decreased after 48 hours , therefore , one of the time periods chosen to evaluate the antimicrobial assessment was after the second day . \n calcium hydroxide requires a minimum period of seven days as an intracanal dressing , therefore , in half of the specimens the medications were kept for seven days . the direct contact test method using spectrophotometry was selected for this study as the optical density of the broth ( containing dentinal debris ) , which was directly related to the number of microorganisms present , and therefore , could be used to examine the antimicrobial efficacy of a medication . \n this method was especially helpful when a large number of specimens were taken . according to the results of this study calcium hydroxide with propylene glycol ( group ii ) and 2% chlorhexidine gel ( group iv ) performed the best for e.faecalis,and the differences between their antibacterial activities were not statistically significant . \n the possible reason for the antimicrobial action of calcium hydroxide with propylene glycol might be due to the mechanism of action of the antimicrobial activity of propylene glycol , as given in the book  antimicrobials in food, by michael davidson ; which was related to the tendency of its molecules to orient themselves between the lipid and the water phases of the microbial membrane , which possibly altered the permeability of the cell membrane function . as the fungal cell wall mainly contained chitin ( polysaccharide ) and the cell membrane of sterols , propylene glycol might be more effective for e.faecalis , which had lipoteichoic acid as a major component of the cell membrane . \n the results of this study showed that for c.albicans , group iii ( calcium hydroxide with iodoform ) and group iv ( 2%chlorhexidine gel ) had the highest antifungal activity , and the differences between their antifungal activities were not statistically significant . \n the antimicrobial action of calcium hydroxide with iodoform against c. albicans might be due to the role of the calcium ions in the regulation of c. albicans morphogenesis . \n the antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide , due to the release of hydroxyl ions , might be enhanced due to the inhibition of c.albicans growth by calcium ions . \n this might be the possible cause for the better performance of group iii , for c.albicans . \n chlorhexidine has a reasonably wide range of activity against aerobic and anaerobic organisms as well as the candida species \n the inhibition of the growth of e.faecalis and c.albicans at 200 m and 400 m was uniform , with no statistical difference . \n the antimicrobial action of all the three medicaments increased on the seventh day as compared to that on the second day , for both the organisms tested in the study . \n propylene glycol was hygroscopic in nature , and therefore , there was a sustained release of hydroxyl ions from calcium hydroxide \n . this might be the reason for the increased antimicrobial activity of group ii on the seventh day . \n as oily vehicles have the lowest solubility and diffusion of the paste within the tissues , it might have resulted in the better antimicrobial action of group iii on the seventh day . \n for chlorhexidine , it had the property of substantivity , which might have been responsible for its higher antimicrobial activity in group iv on the seventh day as compared to the second day . \n results obtained from the in vitro laboratory experimental study can not be directly extended to the clinical situation ; however , they do provide reproducible and reliable means for comparing and testing the antimicrobial efficacy of various intracanal medicaments . \n from the results of this study it was concluded that : \n two percent chlorhexidine gel was an effective antibacterial and antifungal intracanal medicament against e.faecalis and c.albicans , respectively.the type of vehicle used would alter the antimicrobial property of calcium hydroxide as an intracanal medicament.addition of propylene glycol to calcium hydroxide as an intracanal medicament made calcium hydroxide an effective antibacterial agent against e.faecalis.addition of iodoform with silicone oil to calcium hydroxide as an intracanal medicament made calcium hydroxide an effective antifungal agent against c.albicans . \n two percent chlorhexidine gel was an effective antibacterial and antifungal intracanal medicament against e.faecalis and c.albicans , respectively . \n the type of vehicle used would alter the antimicrobial property of calcium hydroxide as an intracanal medicament . \n addition of propylene glycol to calcium hydroxide as an intracanal medicament made calcium hydroxide an effective antibacterial agent

Introduction\nIn England's countryside, there lived a young lass,\nWhose parents had passed, leaving her alone in a vast,\nEstate owned by her uncle, a man so austere,\nWho had no time for her, nor care to appear.\n\nMary was her name, and she felt quite alone,\nNo friends to play with, no one to call her own,\nBut one day while exploring, she found a surprise,\nA secret garden, hidden away from prying eyes.\n\n1. Discovery of the Garden\nThe garden was locked up, with a rusted old key,\nBut Mary was curious, she wanted to see,\nWhat was inside that garden, what lay beyond,\nSo she searched high and low, till she found the bond.\n\nAs she walked through the garden, she felt a strange thrill,\nSeeing flowers and trees that had been silent and still,\nFor years they had slept, but now they awoke,\nAnd Mary felt a stirring, a strange, joyous poke.\n\n1. Friendship with Dickon\nSoon, Mary met a boy, a farmer's son,\nHis name was Dickon, he was full of fun,\nHe showed her the ways of the garden, and how,\nTo plant, water, and care for each flower and bough.\n\nTogether they worked, till the garden was bright,\nWith colors so vivid, a truly wonderful sight,\nMary had found a friend, one that was true,\nSomeone who helped her, when she was feeling blue.\n\n1. The Transformation of the Garden\nOver time, the garden transformed, bloomed, and grew,\nMary and Dickon had done it, they knew what to do,\nThe garden was alive, with sounds and scents so rare,\nA place that was magical, beyond compare.\n\nThe garden became a symbol, of hope and of love,\nFor those who were hurting, who felt lost, who needed a shove,\nIt reminded them that with effort and care,\nThey too could grow something, that was lovely and fair.\n\n1. Conclusion\nMary had found something, beyond wealth or fame,\nA garden that grew, a friendship that came,\nFrom working together, and never giving up,\nEven when things seemed hard, like an empty cup.\n\nThe garden taught her, the value of life,\nAnd how even in sorrow, there's a chance to thrive,\nMary's journey was a lesson, for young and old,\nAbout the power of friendship, and the beauty that's told.\n\nMoral of the Story:\nThrough Mary's journey, we learn that friendship is key,\nTo growth, transformation, and living life fully,\nWith hard work and perseverance, anything's possible,\nA secret garden of love and hope, that's truly remarkable.", 582, 19, "sharegpt"], [195, "In a basketball game, Tobee scored 4 points.
